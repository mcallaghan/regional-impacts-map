abstract = {Negative emission (NE) technologies are recognized to play an increasingly relevant role in strategies limiting mean global warming to 1.5 °C as specified in the Paris Agreement. The potentially significant contribution of pyrogenic carbon capture and storage (PyCCS) is, however, highly underrepresented in the discussion. In this study, we conduct the first quantitative assessment of the global potential of PyCCS as a NE technology based on biomass plantations. Using a process-based biosphere model, we calculate the land use change required to reach specific climate mitigation goals while observing biodiversity protection guardrails. We consider NE targets of 100–300 GtC following socioeconomic pathways consistent with a mean global warming of 1.5 °C as well as the option of additional carbon balancing required in case of failure or delay of decarbonization measures. The technological opportunities of PyCCS are represented by three tracks accounting for the sequestration of different pyrolysis products: biochar (as soil amendment), bio-oil (pumped into geological storages) and permanent-pyrogas (capture and storage of CO 2 from gas combustion). In addition, we analyse how the gain in land induced by biochar-mediated yield increases on tropical cropland may reduce the pressure on land. Our results show that meeting the 1.5 °C goal through mitigation strategies including large-scale NE with plantation-based PyCCS may require conversion of natural vegetation to biomass plantations in the order of 133–3280 Mha globally, depending on the applied technology and the NE demand. Advancing towards additional bio-oil sequestration reduces land demand considerably by potentially up to 60{\%}, while the benefits from yield increases account for another 3{\%}–38{\%} reduction (equalling 82–362 Mha). However, when mitigation commitments are increased by high balancing claims, even the most advanced PyCCS technologies and biochar-mediated co-benefits cannot compensate for delayed action towards phasing-out fossil fuels.},

abstract = {This paper synthesizes results of the multi-model Energy Modeling Forum 27 (EMF27) with a focus on climate policy scenarios. The study included two harmonized long-term climate targets of 450 ppm CO2-e (enforced in 2100) and 550 pm CO2-e (not-to-exceed) as well as two more fragmented policies based on national and regional emissions targets. Stabilizing atmospheric GHG concentrations at 450 and 550 ppm CO2-e requires a dramatic reduction of carbon emissions compared to baseline levels. Mitigation pathways for the 450 CO2-e target are largely overlapping with the 550 CO2-e pathways in the first half of the century, and the lower level is achieved through rapid reductions in atmospheric concentrations in the second half of the century aided by negative anthropogenic carbon flows. A fragmented scenario designed to extrapolate current levels of ambition into the future falls short of the emissions reductions required under the harmonized targets. In a more aggressive scenario intended to capture a break from observed levels of stringency, emissions are still somewhat higher in the second half due to unabated emissions from non-participating countries, emphasizing that a phase-out of global emissions in the long term can only be reached with full global participation. A key finding is that a large range of energy-related CO2 emissions can be compatible with a given long-term target, depending on assumptions about carbon cycle response, non-CO2 and land use CO2 emissions abatement, partly explaining the spread in mitigation costs.},

abstract = {The 2015 Paris Agreement calls for countries to pursue efforts to limit global-mean temperature rise to 1.5 °C. The transition pathways that can meet such a target have not, however, been extensively explored. Here we describe scenarios that limit end-of-century radiative forcing to 1.9 W m−2, and consequently restrict median warming in the year 2100 to below 1.5 °C. We use six integrated assessment models and a simple climate model, under different socio-economic, technological and resource assumptions from five Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). Some, but not all, SSPs are amenable to pathways to 1.5 °C. Successful 1.9 W m−2 scenarios are characterized by a rapid shift away from traditional fossil-fuel use towards large-scale low-carbon energy supplies, reduced energy use, and carbon-dioxide removal. However, 1.9 W m−2 scenarios could not be achieved in several models under SSPs with strong inequalities, high baseline fossil-fuel use, or scattered short-term climate policy. Further research can help policy-makers to understand the real-world implications of these scenarios.},

abstract = {Canada, Mexico and the United States formed the North American Carbon Atlas Partnership (NACAP) in December 2008 to collaborate in the development of a North American Carbon Storage Atlas (NACSA). This partnership was formally announced by the Presidents of the United States and Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada at their meeting in Guadalajara, Mexico, in August 2009. The NACAP effort identified and quantified large stationary sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, identified and screened sedimentary basins suitable for CO2 storage, and estimated the CO2 storage resources of the three most common types of geological media-oil and gas reservoirs, unmineable coal and deep saline formations-in those basins using publicly available geological data. To develop the atlas NACAP had to harmonize storage resource estimation methodologies, define a common scale and resolution, and develop procedures for the treatment of shared sedimentary basins across national borders. Although North America is a large emitter of CO2, the results of the assessments by the three countries demonstrate that potential CO2 storage resources in North America are hundreds, if not thousands, of times greater than current CO2 emissions. Certainly, practical considerations will reduce these estimates. The maps of the large stationary CO2 sources and of the CO2 storage resources show that the sources and storage resources frequently either overlay each other or are within manageable distances of each other, making carbon capture and storage an attractive option to reduce CO2 emissions.},

abstract = {The chemical weathering of rocks currently absorbs about 1.1 Gt CO2 a−1 being mainly stored as bicarbonate in the ocean. An enhancement of this slow natural process could remove substantial amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere, aiming to offset some unavoidable anthropogenic emissions in order to comply with the Paris Agreement, while at the same time it may decrease ocean acidification. We provide the first comprehensive assessment of economic costs, energy requirements, technical parameterization, and global and regional carbon removal potential. The crucial parameters defining this potential are the grain size and weathering rates. The main uncertainties about the potential relate to weathering rates and rock mass that can be integrated into the soil. The discussed results do not specifically address the enhancement of weathering through microbial processes, feedback of geogenic nutrient release, and bioturbation. We do not only assess dunite rock, predominantly bearing olivine (in the form of forsterite) as the mineral that has been previously proposed to be best suited for carbon removal, but focus also on basaltic rock to minimize potential negative side effects. Our results show that enhanced weathering is an option for carbon dioxide removal that could be competitive already at 60 US {\$} t−1 CO2 removed for dunite, but only at 200 US {\$} t−1 CO2 removed for basalt. The potential carbon removal on cropland areas could be as large as 95 Gt CO2 a−1 for dunite and 4.9 Gt CO2 a−1 for basalt. The best suited locations are warm and humid areas, particularly in India, Brazil, South-East Asia and China, where almost 75{\%} of the global potential can be realized. This work presents a techno-economic assessment framework, which also allows for the incorporation of further processes.},

abstract = {Abstract  The capture and storage of CO2 from combustion of fossil fuels is gaining attraction as a means to deal with climate change. CO2 emissions from biomass conversion processes can also be captured. If that is done, biomass energy with CO2 capture and storage (BECS) would become a technology that removes CO2 from the atmosphere and at the same time deliver CO2-neutral energy carriers (heat, electricity or hydrogen) to society. Here we present estimates of the costs and conversion efficiency of electricity, hydrogen and heat generation from fossil fuels and biomass with CO2 capture and storage. We then insert these technology characteristics into a global energy and transportation model (GET 5.0), and calculate costs of stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentration at 350 and 450 ppm. We find that carbon capture and storage technologies applied to fossil fuels have the potential to reduce the cost of meeting the 350 ppm stabilisation targets by 50{\%} compared to a case where these technologies are not available and by 80{\%} when BECS is allowed. For the 450 ppm scenario, the reduction in costs is 40 and 42{\%}, respectively. Thus, the difference in costs between cases where BECS technologies are allowed and where they are not is marginal for the 450 ppm stabilization target. It is for very low stabilization targets that negative emissions become warranted, and this makes BECS more valuable than in cases with higher stabilization targets. Systematic and stochastic sensitivity analysis is performed. Finally, BECS opens up the possibility to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. But this option should not be seen as an argument in favour of doing nothing about the climate problem now and then switching on this technology if climate change turns out to be a significant problem. It is not likely that BECS can be initiated sufficiently rapidly at a sufficient scale to follow this path to avoiding abrupt and serious climate changes if that would happen.},

abstract = {Whether there is sufficient geologic CO2 storage capacity to allow CCS to play a significant role in mitigating climate change has been the subject of debate since the 1990s. This paper presents a meta- Analysis of a large body of recently published literature to derive updated estimates of the global deep geologic storage resource as well as the potential demand for this geologic CO2 storage resource over the course of this century. This analysis reveals that, for greenhouse gas emissions mitigation scenarios that have end-of-century atmospheric CO2 concentrations of between 350 ppmv and 725 ppmv, the average demand for deep geologic CO2 storage over the course of this century is between 410 GtCO2 and 1,670 GtCO2. The literature summarized here suggests that - depending on the stringency of criteria applied to calculate storage capacity - global geologic CO2 storage capacity could be: 35,300 GtCO2 of "theoretical" capacity; 13,500 GtCO2 of "effective" capacity; 3,900 GtCO2, of "practical" capacity; and 290 GtCO2 of "matched" capacity for the few regions where this narrow definition of capacity has been calculated. The cumulative demand for geologic CO2 storage is likely quite small compared to global estimates of the deep geologic CO2 storage capacity, and therefore, a "lack" of deep geologic CO2 storage capacity is unlikely to be an impediment for the commercial adoption of CCS technologies in this century.},

abstract = {Evidence-based policy is a dominant theme in contemporary public services but the practical realities and challenges involved in using evidence in policy-making are formidable. Part of the problem is one of complexity. In health services and other public services, we are dealing with complex social interventions which act on complex social systems--things like league tables, performance measures, regulation and inspection, or funding reforms. These are not 'magic bullets' which will always hit their target, but programmes whose effects are crucially dependent on context and implementation. Traditional methods of review focus on measuring and reporting on programme effectiveness, often find that the evidence is mixed or conflicting, and provide little or no clue as to why the intervention worked or did not work when applied in different contexts or circumstances, deployed by different stakeholders, or used for different purposes. This paper offers a model of research synthesis which is designed to work with complex social interventions or programmes, and which is based on the emerging 'realist' approach to evaluation. It provides an explanatory analysis aimed at discerning what works for whom, in what circumstances, in what respects and how. The first step is to make explicit the programme theory (or theories)--the underlying assumptions about how an intervention is meant to work and what impacts it is expected to have. We then look for empirical evidence to populate this theoretical framework, supporting, contradicting or modifying the programme theories as it goes. The results of the review combine theoretical understanding and empirical evidence, and focus on explaining the relationship between the context in which the intervention is applied, the mechanisms by which it works and the outcomes which are produced. The aim is to enable decision-makers to reach a deeper understanding of the intervention and how it can be made to work most effectively. Realist review does not provide simple answers to complex questions. It will not tell policy-makers or managers whether something works or not, but will provide the policy and practice community with the kind of rich, detailed and highly practical understanding of complex social interventions which is likely to be of much more use to them when planning and implementing programmes at a national, regional or local level.},

abstract = {Abstract Eleven coupled climate–carbon cycle models used a common protocol to study the coupling between climate change and the carbon cycle. The models were forced by historical emissions and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 anthropogenic emissions of CO2 for the 1850–2100 time period. For each model, two simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1° and 1.5°C. All models simulated a negative sensitivity for both the land and the ocean carbon cycle to future climate. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean. Also, a majority of the models located the reduction of land carbon uptake in the Tropics. However, the attribution of the land sensitivity to changes in net primary productivity versus changes in respiration is still subject to debate; no consensus emerged among the models.},

abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated that global mean surface air warming is approximately proportional to cumulative CO 2 emissions. This proportional relationship has received considerable attention, as it allows one to calculate the cumulative CO 2 emissions (‘carbon budget') compatible with temperature targets and is a useful measure for model inter-comparison. Here we use an Earth system model to explore whether this relationship persists during periods of net negative CO 2 emissions. Negative CO 2 emissions are required in the majority of emissions scenarios limiting global warming to 2 °C above pre-industrial, with emissions becoming net negative in the second half of this century in several scenarios. We find that for model simulations with a symmetric 1{\%} per year increase and decrease in atmospheric CO 2 , the temperature change ($\Delta$ T ) versus cumulative CO 2 emissions (CE) relationship is nonlinear during periods of net negative emissions, owing to the lagged response of the deep ocean to previously increasing atmospheric CO 2 . When corrected for this lagged response, or if the CO 2 decline is applied after the system has equilibrated with the previous CO 2 increase, the $\Delta$ T versus CE relationship is close to linear during periods of net negative CO 2 emissions. A proportionality constant—the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE)− can therefore be calculated for both positive and net negative CO 2 emission periods. We find that in simulations with a symmetric 1{\%} per year increase and decrease in atmospheric CO 2 the TCRE is larger on the upward than on the downward CO 2 trajectory, suggesting that positive CO 2 emissions are more effective at warming than negative emissions are at subsequently cooling. We also find that the cooling effectiveness of negative CO 2 emissions decreases if applied at higher atmospheric CO 2 concentrations.},

This knowledge is essential to evaluate the capacity of biochar for long-term soil C sequestration fully. In this study two biochars, produced by slow pyrolysis at 450 or 550◦C from a $\delta$13C-depleted (−36.4‰) Eucalyptus saligna Sm. woody material, were incubated in four soils (Inceptisol, Entisol, Oxisol and Vertisol) of contrasting chemical and mineralogical properties. The total biochar-C mineralized over 12 months was 0.30–1.14 and 0.97–2.71{\%} from the soil-biochar mixtures incubated at 20 and 40◦C, respectively. The total biochar-C mineralized (mg CO2-C per unit of native soil organic C (SOC) basis) from soils incubated with the 450◦C biochar was approximately twice the corresponding amount mineralized from the 550◦C biochar systems. The influence of soil properties on biochar-C mineralization was greater for the 450◦C biochar than the 550◦C biochar. The smallest proportion of C mineralized from the 450◦C biochar occurred in the Inceptisol incubated at 20◦C and in the Oxisol at 40◦C. However, when expressed on a per unit of native SOC basis, the C mineralization of the 450 and 550◦C biochars was least in the Oxisol and greatest in the Inceptisol at both incubation temperatures. Mean residence times (MRTs) of the biochars estimated using the two-pool exponential model varied between 44 and 610 years. The estimated MRT of the biochars may vary under field conditions depending upon the environmental conditions and addition of labile C from plants. Our results indicate that biochar-C was stabilized by variable charge minerals in the Oxisol and that the stabilization occurred rapidly at high temperatures.},

abstract = {This paper uses the EMF27 scenarios to explore the role of renewable energy (RE) in climate change mitigation. Currently RE supplies almost 20 {\%} of global electricity demand. Almost all EMF27 mitigation scenarios show a strong increase in renewable power production, with a substantial ramp-up of wind and solar power deployment. In many scenarios, renewables are the most important long-term mitigation option for power supply. Wind energy is competitive even without climate policy, whereas the prospects of solar photovoltaics (PV) are highly contingent on the ambitiousness of climate policy. Bioenergy is an important and versatile energy carrier; however—with the exception of low temperature heat—there is less scope for renewables other than biomass for non-electric energy supply. Despite the important role of wind and solar power in climate change mitigation scenarios with full technology availability, limiting their deployment has a relatively small effect on mitigation costs, if nuclear and carbon capture and storage (CCS)—which can serve as substitutes in low-carbon power supply—are available. Limited bioenergy availability in combination with limited wind and solar power by contrast, results in a more substantial increase in mitigation costs. While a number of robust insights emerge, the results on renewable energy deployment levels vary considerably across the models. An in-depth analysis of a subset of EMF27 reveals substantial differences in modeling approaches and parameter assumptions. To a certain degree, differences in model results can be attributed to different assumptions about technology costs, resource potentials and systems integration.},

abstract = {Bio-energy, that is, energy produced from organic non-fossil material of biological origin, is promoted as a substitute for non-renewable (e.g., fossil) energy to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and dependency on energy imports. At present, global bio-energy use amounts to approximately 50 EJ/yr, about 10{\%} of humanity's primary energy supply. We here review recent literature on the amount of bio-energy that could be supplied globally in 2050, given current expectations on technology, food demand and environmental targets ([`]technical potential'). Recent studies span a large range of global bio-energy potentials from [approximate]30 to over 1000 EJ/yr. In our opinion, the high end of the range is implausible because of (1) overestimation of the area available for bio-energy crops due to insufficient consideration of constraints (e.g., area for food, feed or nature conservation) and (2) too high yield expectations resulting from extrapolation of plot-based studies to large, less productive areas. According to this review, the global technical primary bio-energy potential in 2050 is in the range of 160-270 EJ/yr if sustainability criteria are considered. The potential of bio-energy crops is at the lower end of previously published ranges, while residues from food production and forestry could provide significant amounts of energy based on an integrated optimization ([`]cascade utilization') of biomass flows.},

In spite of the limited experience and information available in this field, it is prudent to explore this topic to gain insights into the factors that need to be monitored, the control technologies that may require incorporation into plant design, and the environmental standards that will need to be established. This is done against a background of the general health effects of present coal use technologies. Coal combustion may result in a wide range of substances being emitted to the atmosphere: particulates, sulfur dioxide (SO2), mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), polycyclic organic matter (POM), and trace metals. Many of these are potential human health hazards. Health damage functions for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are the next most important in relation to coal combustion. NO2, being an oxidant, acts quite differently from the reducing sulfur-particulate mix. It is not highly correlated with sulfate incidence. As the coal conversion industry is in its infancy, there are few occupational or environmental health studies available. The chapter reviews these studies and discusses some approaches that have been proposed for environmental and occupational health protection.},

Despite the low soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, total SOC pool of soils of the drylands is 241 Pg (1 Pg = petagram = 10(15)g = 1 billion metric ton) or 15.5{\%} of the world's total of 1550 Pg to 1-meter depth. Desertification has caused historic C loss of 20 to 30 Pg. Assuming that two-thirds of the historic loss can be resequestered, the total potential of SOC sequestration is 12 to 20 Pg C over a 50-year period. Land use and management practices to sequester SOC include afforestation with appropriate species, soil management on cropland, pasture management on grazing land, and restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems through afforestation and conversion to other restorative land uses. Tree species suitable for afforestation in dryland ecosystems include Mesquite, Acacia, Neem and others. Recommended soil management practices include application of biosolids (e.g., manure, sludge), which enhance activity of soil macrofauna (e.g., termites), use of vegetative mulches, water harvesting, and judicious irrigation systems. Recommended practices of managing grazing lands include controlled grazing at an optimal stocking rate, fire management, and growing improved species. The estimated potential of SOC sequestration is about 1 Pg C/y for the world and 50 Tg C/y for the U.S. This potential of dryland soils is relevant to both the Kyoto Protocol under UNFCCC and the U.S. Farm Bill 2002.},

abstract = {Abstract Possible negative effects of increased competition for land include pressures on biodiversity, rising food prices and GHG emissions. However, neoclassical economists often highlight positive aspects of competition, e.g. increased efficiency and innovation. Competition for land occurs when several agents demand the same good or service produced from a limited area. It implies that when one agent acquires scarce resources from land, less resource is available for competing agents. The resource competed for is often not land but rather its function for biomass production, which may be supplanted by other inputs that raise yields. Increased competition may stimulate efficiency but negative environmental effects are likely in the absence of appropriate regulations. Competition between affluent countries with poor people in subsistence economies likely results in adverse social and development outcomes if not mitigated through effective policies. The socioecological metabolism approach is a framework to analyze land-related limits and functions in particular with respect to production and consumption of biomass and carbon sequestration. It can generate databases that consistently link land used with biomass flows which are useful in understanding interlinkages between different products and services and thereby help to analyze systemic feedbacks in the global land system.},

QCA and connected methods can be considered at two levels: as a research strategy and as a set of concrete techniques. The author first argues that such a strategy displays some decisive advantages in social science research, especially in small- and inter- mediate-Nresearch designs. Second, QCA as well as three other related techniques, namely multi-value QCA (MVQCA), fuzzy sets and MSDO/MDSO, are presented in brief, and some current debates with regard to these techniques are also summar- ized. In the third section, the article surveys recent contributions and ongoing efforts that have provided some advances in the application of these techniques, around five key issues: case selection and model specification; measurement, dichotomization and linkage with theory; contradictions and non-observed cases; the time and process dimension; and the confrontation or combination with other methods. Finally, the article discuss the potential for further development of these methods in social science research broadly defined},

Although a consistent definition is lacking, there is agreement that big data are characterized by the increasing volume, variety, and velocity of data streams (2, 3). Climate science has long used large datasets to understand the functioning of the climate system, but the field has been slow to use the passively generated information from digital devices and services that characterize big data (4). In the human dimensions community, big data have rarely been used, aside from studies measuring public opinion on climate change based on social media posts. Despite this neglect, vast amounts of geocoded data on human–environment interactions relevant to adaptation already exist digitally and are being added daily. Such data are not limited to the developed world, with widespread global cell phone coverage and social media use for example (5). Potential adaptation applications of these data are numerous.

Vulnerability research provides essential information for adaptation decision-making by identifying and characterizing who and what are vulnerable to climate change, to what risks, why, and over what timescales. The vulnerability field has expanded considerably over the last decade, although many gaps in understanding vulnerability processes and drivers remain—particularly concerning the real-time nature of human–environment {\ldots}

abstract = {We compared alternate uses of cereal straw (4.25 t dry matter ha-1 containing 1.7 t carbon (C)) for their effectiveness in relation to climate change mitigation. The scenarios were (1) incorporation into soil to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) content ("carbon sequestration") and (2) combustion to generate electricity. The Rothamsted Carbon Model was used to estimate SOC accumulation in a silty clay loam soil under the climatic conditions of north-west Europe. Using straw for electricity generation saved seven times more CO2 than from SOC accumulation. This comparison assumed that electricity from straw combustion displaced that generated from coal and used the mean annual accumulation of SOC over 100 yr. SOC increased most rapidly in the early years, but then more slowly as a new equilibrium value was approached. We suggest that increased SOC from straw incorporation does not represent genuine climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration. In Europe, most straw not already incorporated in the field where it is grown is subsequently returned elsewhere, e.g., after use for animal bedding and production of manure. Only additional retention of C in soil compared to the alternative use represents sequestration. Maintenance of SOC for soil functioning is a more appropriate rationale for returning straw to soil than climate change mitigation. This analysis shows that considerably greater climate change mitigation is achieved through saved CO2 emissions by burning straw for electricity generation, replacing some use of fossil fuel. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, lack of confidence in geologic CO2 storage security remains a barrier to CCS implementation. Here we present a numerical program that calculates CO2 storage security and leakage to the atmosphere over 10,000 years. This combines quantitative estimates of geological subsurface CO2 retention, and of surface CO2 leakage. We calculate that realistically well-regulated storage in regions with moderate well densities has a 50{\%} probability that leakage remains below 0.0008{\%} per year, with over 98{\%} of the injected CO2 retained in the subsurface over 10,000 years. An unrealistic scenario, where CO2 storage is inadequately regulated, estimates that more than 78{\%} will be retained over 10,000 years. Our modelling results suggest that geological storage of CO2 can be a secure climate change mitigation option, but we note that long-term behaviour of CO2 in the subsurface remains a key uncertainty.},

abstract = {The Paris Agreement of the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change refers to the 1.5 °C target as well as the 2 °C target, and it is important to estimate the emission pathways and mitigation measures for the 1.5 °C target for the discussions on the target. The possible emission pathways vary widely because of the uncertainties involved. We assumed three kinds of temperature trajectories for meeting below 1.5 °C compared with the pre-industrial level, and three numbers for the climate sensitivity. The first trajectory remains below 1.5 °C all the time until 2300, the second overshoots but returns to below 1.5 °C by 2100, and the third overshoots but returns to below 1.5 °C by 2300. There are large differences in terms of 2030 emissions between the estimate from the submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and any of assessed emission pathways involving climate sensitivity of 3.0 °C or higher, and high emission reduction costs were estimated, even for 2030. With climate sensitivity of 2.5 °C, only the third trajectory exhibits consistent emissions in 2030 with the NDCs. However, this case also appears very difficult to achieve, requiring enormous amounts of negative emissions after the middle of this century toward 2300. A climate mitigation strategy aiming for the 1.5 °C target will be debatable, because we face serious difficulties in near- or/and long-term for all the possible emission pathways, and therefore, we should rather focus on actual emission reduction activities than on the 1.5 °C target with poor feasibility.},

Yet despite its importance for science and policy, our understanding of the causes of widespread uncertainty and doubt found among the general public remains limited. The political and social processes driving such doubt and uncertainty are difficult to rigorously analyse, and research has tended to focus on the individual-level, rather than the larger institutions and social networks that produce and disseminate contrarian information. This study presents a new approach by using network science to uncover the institutional and corporate structure of the climate change counter-movement, and machine-learningtextanalysis toshowitsinfluenceinthenews media and bureaucratic politics.

abstract = {In this article, we evaluate and compare results from three integrated assessment models (GCAM, IMAGE, and ReMIND/MAgPIE) regarding the drivers and impacts of bioenergy production on the global land system. The considered model frameworks employ linked energy, economy, climate and land use modules. By the help of these linkages the direct competition of bioenergy with other energy technology options for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, based on economic costs and GHG emissions from bioenergy production, has been taken into account. Our results indicate that dedicated bioenergy crops and biomass residues form a potentially important and cost-effective input into the energy system. At the same time, however, the results differ strongly in terms of deployment rates, feedstock composition and land-use and greenhouse gas implications. The current paper adds to earlier work by specific looking into model differences with respect to the land-use component that could contribute to the noted differences in results, including land cover allocation, land use constraints, energy crop yields, and non-bioenergy land mitigation options modeled. In scenarios without climate change mitigation, bioenergy cropland represents 10–18 {\%} of total cropland by 2100 across the different models, and boosts cropland expansion at the expense of carbon richer ecosystems. Therefore, associated emissions from land-use change and agricultural intensification as a result of bio-energy use range from 14 and 113 Gt CO2-eq cumulatively through 2100. Under climate policy, bioenergy cropland increases to 24–36 {\%} of total cropland by 2100.},

abstract = {In order to meet stringent temperature targets, active removal of CO2 from the atmosphere may be required in the long run. Such negative emissions can be materialized when well-performing bioenergy systems are combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Here, we develop an integrated global energy system and climate model to evaluate the role of BECCS in reaching ambitious temperature targets. We present emission, concentration and temperature pathways towards 1.5 and 2 ° C targets. Our model results demonstrate that BECCS makes it feasible to reach temperature targets that are otherwise out of reach, provided that a temporary overshoot of the target is accepted. Additionally, stringent temperature targets can be met at considerably lower cost if BECCS is available. However, the economic benefit of BECCS nearly vanishes if an overshoot of the temperature target is not allowed. Finally, the least-cost emission pathway over the next 50 years towards a 1.5 ° C overshoot target with BECCS is almost identical to a pathway leading to a 2 ° C ceiling target. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

But, significant expansion of bioenergy production can have a large terrestrial footprint. In this paper, we test the implications for land use, the global energy system, emissions and mitigation costs of meeting a specific climate target, using a single fossil fuel and industrial sector policy instrument, but with five alternative bioenergy and land-use policy architectures. These scenarios are illustrative in nature, and designed to explore trade-offs. We find that the policies we examined have differing effects on the different segments of the economy. Comprehensive land policies can reduce land-use change emissions, increasing allowable emissions in the energy system, but have implications for the cost of food. Bioenergy penalties and constraints, on the other hand, have little effect on food prices, but result in less bioenergy and thus can increase mitigation costs and energy prices.},

abstract = {Advances in the science and observation of climate change are providing a clearer understanding of the inherent variability of Earth's climate system and its likely response to human and natural influences. The implications of climate change for the environment and society will depend not only on the response of the Earth system to changes in radiative forcings, but also on how humankind responds through changes in technology, economies, lifestyle and policy. Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options. To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists. Here we describe a new process for creating plausible scenarios to investigate some of the most challenging and important questions about climate change confronting the global community.},

abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is broadly recognised as having the potential to play a key in meeting climate change targets, delivering low carbon power, decarbonising industry and, more recently, its ability to facilitate the net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. However, despite this broad consensus and technical maturity, CCS has not yet been deployed on a scale commensurate with the ambitions articulated a decade ago. Thus, in this paper we review the current state-of-the-art of CO2 capture, transport, utilisation and storage from a multi-scale perspective, moving from the global to molecular length scales. In light of the COP21 commitments to limit warming to less than 2C, we extend the remit of this study to include the key negative emissions technologies (NETs) of bioenergy and CCS (BECCS) and direct air capture (DAC). Cognisant of the non-technical barriers to deploying CCS, we capitalise on recent experience from the UK's CCS commercialisation programme and consider the commercial and political economy barriers to the large-scale deployment of CCS. In all areas, we focus on identifying and clearly articulating the key research challenges that could usefully be addressed by the academic community in the coming decade.},

abstract = {How can assessments of environmental policy issues be policy-relevant without being policy-prescriptive? The predominant technocratic and decisionist responses to this question misleadingly assume that value-neutral scientific recommendations for public policy means, or even objectives, are possible. On the other end of the spectrum, the literature on democratic and pragmatic models of expertise in policy often does not satisfactorily explain what researchers can contribute to public discourses surrounding disputed, value-laden policy objectives and means. Building on John Dewey's philosophy, this article develops the “pragmatic-enlightened model” (PEM) of assessment making, which refines the existing pragmatic models. It is used to some extent by Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. According to the PEM's policy assessment methodology, policy objectives and their means can only be evaluated in light of the practical consequences of the means. Learning about the secondary effects, side effects and synergies of the best means may require a revaluation of the policy objectives, for instance, regarding the use of bioenergy for climate mitigation. Following the PEM, assessments would—based on a thorough problem analysis—explore alternative policy pathways, including their diverse practical consequences, overlaps and trade-offs, in cooperation with stakeholders. Such an arduous interdisciplinary cartography of multiple objectives, multi-functional policy means and the broad range of their quantitative and qualitative practical consequences may face considerable practical challenges and uncertainty. Yet, it could make assessments more policy-relevant and less prescriptive, and could effectively support a learning process about the political solution space.},

abstract = {Human activities, especially conversion and degradation of habitats, are causing global biodiversity declines. How local ecological assemblages are responding is less clear[mdash]a concern given their importance for many ecosystem functions and services. We analysed a terrestrial assemblage database of unprecedented geographic and taxonomic coverage to quantify local biodiversity responses to land use and related changes. Here we show that in the worst-affected habitats, these pressures reduce within-sample species richness by an average of 76.5{\%}, total abundance by 39.5{\%} and rarefaction-based richness by 40.3{\%}. We estimate that, globally, these pressures have already slightly reduced average within-sample richness (by 13.6{\%}), total abundance (10.7{\%}) and rarefaction-based richness (8.1{\%}), with changes showing marked spatial variation. Rapid further losses are predicted under a business-as-usual land-use scenario; within-sample richness is projected to fall by a further 3.4{\%} globally by 2100, with losses concentrated in biodiverse but economically poor countries. Strong mitigation can deliver much more positive biodiversity changes (up to a 1.9{\%} average increase) that are less strongly related to countries' socioeconomic status.},

abstract = {Although the Paris Agreement's goals ( 1 ) are aligned with science ( 2 ) and can, in principle, be technically and economically achieved ( 3 ), alarming inconsistencies remain between science-based targets and national commitments. Despite progress during the 2016 Marrakech climate negotiations, long-term goals can be trumped by political short-termism. Following the Agreement, which became international law earlier than expected, several countries published mid-century decarbonization strategies, with more due soon. Model-based decarbonization assessments ( 4 ) and scenarios often struggle to capture transformative change and the dynamics associated with it: disruption, innovation, and nonlinear change in human behavior. For example, in just 2 years, China's coal use swung from 3.7{\%} growth in 2013 to a decline of 3.7{\%} in 2015 ( 5 ). To harness these dynamics and to calibrate for short-term realpolitik, we propose framing the decarbonization challenge in terms of a global decadal roadmap based on a simple heuristic—a “carbon law”—of halving gross anthropogenic carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions every decade. Complemented by immediately instigated, scalable carbon removal and efforts to ramp down land-use CO2 emissions, this can lead to net-zero emissions around mid-century, a path necessary to limit warming to well below 2°C.},

abstract = {A combined approach of deliberate CO2 removal (CDR) from the atmosphere alongside reducing CO2 emissions is the best way to minimize the future rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration, and the only timely way to bring the atmospheric CO2 concentration back down if it overshoots safe levels. Here, land-based biological CDR and storage methods are reviewed, including afforestation, biomass burial, biochar production and bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage. The current and future CDR flux they could generate and their total storage capacity for CO2 are quantitatively assessed. The results suggest that there is already the potential to counterbalance land use change CO2 emissions. By mid-century, the CDR flux together with natural sinks could match current total CO2 emissions, thus stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentration. By the end of the century, CDR could exceed CO2 emissions, thus lowering atmospheric CO2 concentration and global temperature.},

abstract = {Combining bioenergy and carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) technologies (BECCS) has the potential to remove CO2 from the atmosphere while producing useful energy. BECCS has played a central role in scenarios that reduce climate forcing to low levels such as 2.6 Wm−2. In this paper we consider whether BECCS is essential to limiting radiative forcing (RF) to 2.6 Wm−2 by 2100 using the Global Change Assessment Model, a closely coupled model of biogeophysical and human Earth systems. We show that BECCS can potentially reduce the cost of limiting RF to 2.6 Wm−2 by 2100 but that a variety of technology combinations that do not include BECCS can also achieve this goal, under appropriate emissions mitigation policies. We note that with appropriate supporting land-use policies terres- trial sequestration could deliver carbon storage ranging from 200 to 700 PgCO2- equiavalent over the 21st century. We explore substantial delays in participation by some geopolitical regions. We find that the value of BECCS is substantially higher under delay and that delay results in higher transient RF and climate change. However, when major regions postponed mitigation indefinitely, it was impossible to return RF to 2.6 Wm−2 by 2100. Neither finite land resources nor finite potential geologic storage capacity represented a meaningful technical limit on the ability of BECCS to contribute to emissions mitigation in the numerical experiments reported in this paper.},

The analysis synthesizes results from the RoSE multi-model study aiming to identify robust and sensitive features of mitigation pathways under these inherently uncertain drivers of energy and emissions developments. Based on an integrated assessment model comparison exercise, we show that economic growth and fossil resource assumptions substantially affect baseline developments, but in no case they lead to the significant greenhouse gas emission reduction that would be needed to achieve long-term climate targets without dedicated climate policy. The influence of economic growth and fossil resource assumptions on climate mitigation pathways is relatively small due to overriding requirements imposed by long-term climate targets. While baseline assumptions can have substantial effects on mitigation costs and carbon prices, we find that the effects of model differences and the stringency of the climate target are larger compared to that of baseline assumptions. We conclude that inherent uncertainties about socio-economic determinants like economic growth and fossil resource availability can be effectively dealt with in the assessment of mitigation pathways.},

abstract = {Bioenergy deployment offers significant potential for climate change mitigation, but also carries considerable risks. In this review, we bring together perspectives of various communities involved in the research and regulation of bioenergy deployment in the context of climate change mitigation: Land-use and energy experts, landuse and integrated assessment modelers, human geographers, ecosystem researchers, climate scientists and two different strands of life-cycle assessment experts. We summarize technological options, outline the state-of-theart knowledge on various climate effects, provide an update on estimates of technical resource potential and comprehensively identify sustainability effects. Cellulosic feedstocks, increased end-use efficiency, improved land carbon-stock management and residue use, and, when fully developed, BECCS appear as the most promising options, depending on development costs, implementation, learning, and risk management. Combined heat and power, efficient biomass cookstoves and small-scale power generation for rural areas can help to promote energy access and sustainable development, along with reduced emissions. We estimate the sustainable technical potential as up to 100 EJ: high agreement; 100–300 EJ: medium agreement; above 300 EJ: low agreement. Stabilization scenarios indicate that bioenergy may supply from 10 to 245 EJ yr 1 to global primary energy supply by 2050. Models indicate that, if technological and governance preconditions are met, large-scale deployment ({\textgreater}200 EJ), together with BECCS, could help to keep global warming below 2° degrees of preindustrial levels; but such high deployment of land-intensive bioenergy feedstocks could also lead to detrimental climate effects, negatively impact ecosystems, biodiversity and livelihoods. The integration of bioenergy systems into agriculture and forest landscapes can improve land and water use efficiency and help address concerns about environmental impacts. We conclude that the high variability in pathways, uncertainties in technological development and ambiguity in political decision render forecasts on deployment levels and climate effects very difficult. However, uncertainty about projections should not preclude pursuing beneficial bioenergy options.},

abstract = {Food production in developing countries, estimated at 1223 million metric tons (Mg), must be increased by 778 million Mg or 2.5 per centy-1 between 2000 and 2025 to meet the needs of an increased population and projected change in diet. Among numerous options, the one based on enhancing soil quality and agronomic productivity per unit area through improvement in soil organic carbon pool has numerous ancillary benefits. The available data show that crop yields can be increased by 20-70 kg ha-1 for wheat, 10-50 kg ha-1 for rice, and 30-300 kg ha-1 for maize with every 1 Mg ha-1 increase in soil organic carbon pool in the root zone. Adoption of recommended management practices on agricultural lands and degraded soils would enhance soil quality including the available water holding capacity, cation exchange capacity, soil aggregation, and susceptibility to crusting and erosion. Increase in soil organic carbon pool by 1 Mg ha-1 y-1 can increase food grain production by 32 million Mg y-1 in developing countries. While advancing food security, this strategy would also off-set fossil fuel emissions at the rate of 0{\textperiodcentered}5 Pg Cy-1 through carbons sequestration in agricultural soils of developing countries.

abstract = {The ‘4 per mille Soils for Food Security and Climate' was launched at the COP21 with an aspiration to increase global soil organic matter stocks by 4 per 1000 (or 0.4 {\%}) per year as a compensation for the global emissions of greenhouse gases by anthropogenic sources. This paper surveyed the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock estimates and sequestration potentials from 20 regions in the world (New Zealand, Chile, South Africa, Australia, Tanzania, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, India, China Taiwan, South Korea, China Mainland, United States of America, France, Canada, Belgium, England {\&} Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and Russia). We asked whether the 4 per mille initiative is feasible for the region. The outcomes highlight region specific efforts and scopes for soil carbon sequestration. Reported soil C sequestration rates globally show that under best management practices, 4 per mille or even higher sequestration rates can be accomplished. High C sequestration rates (up to 10 per mille) can be achieved for soils with low initial SOC stock (topsoil less than 30 t C ha− 1), and at the first twenty years after implementation of best management practices. In addition, areas which have reached equilibrium will not be able to further increase their sequestration. We found that most studies on SOC sequestration only consider topsoil (up to 0.3 m depth), as it is considered to be most affected by management techniques. The 4 per mille number was based on a blanket calculation of the whole global soil profile C stock, however the potential to increase SOC is mostly on managed agricultural lands. If we consider 4 per mille in the top 1m of global agricultural soils, SOC sequestration is between 2-3 Gt C year− 1, which effectively offset 20–35{\%} of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. As a strategy for climate change mitigation, soil carbon sequestration buys time over the next ten to twenty years while other effective sequestration and low carbon technologies become viable. The challenge for cropping farmers is to find disruptive technologies that will further improve soil condition and deliver increased soil carbon. Progress in 4 per mille requires collaboration and communication between scientists, farmers, policy makers, and marketeers.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Background: Evidence of the association of coal mining with health outcomes such as increased mortality and morbidity in the general population has been provided by epidemiological studies in the last 25 years. Given the diverse sources of data included to investigate different health outcomes in the exposed populations, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) can be used as a single classification standard to compare the findings of studies conducted in different socioeconomic and geographic contexts. The ICD classifies diagnoses of diseases and other disorders as codes organized by categories and chapters. Objectives: Identify the ICD codes found in studies of morbidity and/or mortality in populations resident or in proximity of coal mining and assess the methods of these studies conducting a systematic review. Methods: A systematic database search of PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus following the PRISMA protocol was conducted to assess epidemiological studies from 1990 to 2016. The health outcomes were mapped to ICD codes and classified by studies of morbidity and/or mortality, and the categories and chapters of the ICD. Results: Twenty-eight epidemiological studies with ecological design from the USA, Europe and China were included. The exposed populations had increased risk of mortality and/or morbidity by 78 ICD diagnosis categories and 9 groups of ICD categories in 10 chapters of the ICD: Neoplasms, diseases of the circulatory, respiratory and genitourinary systems, metabolic diseases, diseases of the eye and the skin, perinatal conditions, congenital and chromosomal abnormalities, and external causes of morbidity. Exposed populations had non-increased risk of 9 ICD diagnosis categories of diseases of the genitourinary system, and prostate cancer. Conclusions: There is consistent evidence of the association of coal mining with a wide spectrum of diseases in populations resident or in proximity of the mining activities. The methods of the studies included in this review can be integrated with individual-level and longitudinal studies to provide further evidence of the exposure pathways linked to increased risk in the exposed populations.},

abstract = {The increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 by 31{\%} since 1750 from fossil fuel combustion and land use change necessitates identification of strategies for mitigating the threat of the attendant global warming. Since the industrial revolution, global emissions of carbon (C) are estimated at 270±30 Pg (Pg=petagram=1015 g=1 billion ton) due to fossil fuel combustion and 136±55 Pg due to land use change and soil cultivation. Emissions due to land use change include those by deforestation, biomass burning, conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems, drainage of wetlands and soil cultivation. Depletion of soil organic C (SOC) pool have contributed 78±12 Pg of C to the atmosphere. Some cultivated soils have lost one-half to two-thirds of the original SOC pool with a cumulative loss of 30-40 Mg C/ha (Mg=megagram=106 g=1 ton). The depletion of soil C is accentuated by soil degradation and exacerbated by land misuse and soil mismanagement. Thus, adoption of a restorative land use and recommended management practices (RMPs) on agricultural soils can reduce the rate of enrichment of atmospheric CO2 while having positive impacts on food security, agro-industries, water quality and the environment. A considerable part of the depleted SOC pool can be restored through conversion of marginal lands into restorative land uses, adoption of conservation tillage with cover crops and crop residue mulch, nutrient cycling including the use of compost and manure, and other systems of sustainable management of soil and water resources. Measured rates of soil C sequestration through adoption of RMPs range from 50 to 1000 kg/ha/year. The global potential of SOC sequestration through these practices is 0.9±0.3 Pg C/year, which may offset one-fourth to one-third of the annual increase in atmospheric CO2 estimated at 3.3 Pg C/year. The cumulative potential of soil C sequestration over 25-50 years is 30-60 Pg. The soil C sequestration is a truly win-win strategy. It restores degraded soils, enhances biomass production, purifies surface and ground waters, and reduces the rate of enrichment of atmospheric CO2 by offsetting emissions due to fossil fuel. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 from 280 ppmv in 1750 to 367 ppmv in 1999 is attributed to emissions from fossil fuel combustion estimated at 270 +/- 30 Pg C and land use change at 136 +/- 55 Pg. Of the emissions from land use change, 78 +/- 12 Pg is estimated from depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. Most agricultural soils have lost 50 to 70{\%} of their original SOC pool, and the depletion is exacerbated by further soil degradation and desertification. The restoration of degraded soils, conversion of agriculturally marginal lands to appropriate land use, and the adoption of recommended management practices on agricultural soils can reverse degradative trends and lead to SOC sequestration. Technological options for SOC sequestration on agricultural soils include adoption of conservation tillage, use of manures, and compost as per integrated nutrient management and precision fanning strategies, conversion of monoculture to complex diverse cropping systems, meadow-based rotations and winter cover crops, and establishing perennial vegetation on contours and steep slopes. The global potential of SOC sequestration and restoration of degraded/desertified soils is estimated at 0.6 to 1.2 Pg C/y for about 50 years with a cumulative sink capacity of 30 to 60 Pg. The SOC sequestration is a cost-effective strategy of mitigating the climate change during the first 2 to 3 decades of the 21(st) century. While improving soil quality, biomass productivity and enhanced environment quality, the strategy of SOC sequestration also buys us time during which the non-carbon fuel alternatives can take effect.},

abstract = {The ability to directly remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere allows the decoupling of emissions and emissions control in space and time. We ask the question whether this unique feature of carbon dioxide removal technologies fundamentally alters the dynamics of climate mitigation pathways. The analysis is performed in the coupled energy-economy-climate model ReMIND using the bioenergy with CCS route as an application of CDR technology. BECCS is arguably the least cost CDR option if biomass availability is not a strongly limiting factor. We compare mitigation pathways with and without BECCS to explore the impact of CDR technologies on the mitigation portfolio. Effects are most pronounced for stringent climate policies where BECCS is a key technology for the effectiveness of carbon pricing policies. The decoupling of emissions and emissions control allows prolonging the use of fossil fuels in sectors that are difficult to decarbonize, particularly in the transport sector. It also balances the distribution of mitigation costs across future generations. CDR is not a silver bullet technology. The largest part of emissions reductions continues to be provided by direct mitigation measures at the emissions source. The value of CDR lies in its flexibility to alleviate the most costly constraints on mitigating emissions.},

abstract = {The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450–600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the “dust bowl” era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4–1.0 m if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6–1.9 m for peak CO2 concentrations exceeding ≈1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.},

Options for sustained sequestration of C in the soil through adapted management of land resources are re- viewed in the context of the ongoing discussion on the need to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the at- mosphere. Enhanced sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in the soil, ultimately as stable humus, may well prove a more lasting solution than (temporarily) sequestering CO2 in the standing biomass through reforestation and afforestation. Such actions will also help to reverse processes of land degradation, thus contributing to sus- tained food productivity and security for the people in the regions concerned.},

Present levels of anthropogenic emissions involve 6.3 Pg C by fossil fuel emissions and 1.8 Pg C by land-use change. Out of the historic loss of terrestrial C pool of 136+/-55 Pg, 78+/-12 Pg is due to depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC) pool comprising 26+/-9 Pg due to accelerated soil erosion. A large proportion of the historic SOC lost can be resequestered by enhancing the SOC pool through converting to an appropriate land use and adopting recommended management practices (RMPs). The strategy is to return biomass to the soil in excess of the mineralization capacity through restoration of degraded/desertified soils and intensification of agricultural and forestry lands. Technological options for agricultural intensification include conservation tillage and residue mulching, integrated nutrient management, crop rotations involving cover crops, practices which enhance the efficiency of water, plant nutrients and energy use, improved pasture and tree species, controlled grazing, and judicious use of inptus. The potential of SOC sequestration is estimated at 1-2 Pg C yr(-1) for the world, 0.3-0-6 Pg C yr(-1) for Asia, 0.2-0-5 Pg C yr(-1) for Africa and 0.1-0.3 Pg C yr(-1) for North and Central America and South America, 0.1-0.3 Pg C yr(-1) for Europe and 0.1-0.2 Po C yr(-1) for Oceania.

abstract = {To predict the response of C-rich soils to external change, models are needed that accurately reflect the conditions of these soils. Estimation of Carbon in Organic Soils - Sequestration and Emissions (ECOSSE) is a model that allows simulations of soil C and N turnover in both mineral and organic soils using only the limited meteorological, land-use and soil data that is available at the national scale. Because it is able to function at field as well as national scales if appropriate input data are used, field-scale evaluations can be used to determine uncertainty in national simulations. Here we present an evaluation of the uncertainty expected in national-scale simulations of Scotland, using data from the National Soil Inventory of Scotland. This data set provides measurements of C change for the range of soils, climates and land-use types found across Scotland. The simulated values show a high degree of association with the measurements in both total C and change in C content of the soil. Over all sites where land-use change occurred, the average deviation between the simulated and measured values of percentage change in soil C was less than the experimental error (11{\%} simulation error, 53{\%} measurement error). This suggests that the uncertainty in the national-scale simulations will be ∼11{\%}. Only a small bias in the simulations was observed compared to the measured values, suggesting that a small underestimate of the change in soil C should be expected at the national scale (-4{\%}). {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2010.},

abstract = {The organic carbon pool in agricultural land-uses is capable of enhancing agricultural sustainability and serving as a potentialsink of atmospheric carbon dioxide. A study was carried out to estimate and map carbon stock of different agricultural land-usesin a sub-watershed of Thailand and to assess the land-use sustainability with respect to carbon management. A quadratsampling methodology was adopted to estimate the biomass and its carbon content of 11 different land-uses in the study area.Existing soil data were used to calculate the soil carbon. GIS was used for integrating biomass carbon, soil carbon and carbonstock mapping. Roth carbon model was used to project the soil carbon of present land-uses in the coming 10 years and based onwhich the sustainability of land-uses was predicted. The total carbon stock of agricultural land-uses was estimated to be 205 Tg,of which 4149 per cent was biomass carbon and 5851 per cent was soil carbon. Among the land-uses, para rubber had thehighest average biomass C (13634MgC ha1) while paddy had the lowest (708MgC ha1). About four-fifths of agriculturalland-uses in the watershed are sustainable in maintaining the desired level of soil carbon in coming 10 years while one-fifths areunstable. Such information on carbon stock could be valuable to develop viable land-use options for agricultural sustainabilityand carbon sequestration. Copyright {\#} 2007 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the AMPERE modeling comparison project with focus on the implications of near-term policies for the costs and attainability of long-term climate objectives. Nine modeling teams participated in the project to explore the consequences of global emissions following the proposed policy stringency of the national pledges from the Copenhagen Accord and Canc{\'{u}}n Agreements to 2030. Specific features compared to earlier assessments are the explicit consideration of near-term 2030 emission targets as well as the systematic sensitivity analysis for the availability and potential of mitigation technologies. Our estimates show that a 2030 mitigation effort comparable to the pledges would result in a further “lock-in” of the energy system into fossil fuels and thus impede the required energy transformation to reach low greenhouse-gas stabilization levels (450 ppm CO2e). Major implications include significant increases in mitigation costs, increased risk that low stabilization targets become unattainable, and reduced chances of staying below the proposed temperature change target of 2 °C in case of overshoot. With respect to technologies, we find that following the pledge pathways to 2030 would narrow policy choices, and increases the risks that some currently optional technologies, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) or the large-scale deployment of bioenergy, will become “a must” by 2030.},

The magnitude of loss may be 10 to 50. tons. C/ha. Soils with severe depletion of their SOC pool have low agronomic yield and low use efficiency of added input. Conversion to a restorative land use and adoption of recommended management practices, can enhance the SOC pool, improve soil quality, increase agronomic productivity, advance global food security, enhance soil resilience to adapt to extreme climatic events, and mitigate climate change by off-setting fossil fuel emissions. The technical potential of carbon (C) sequestration in soils of the agroecosystems is 1.2-3.1. billion. tons. C/yr. Improvement in soil quality, by increase in the SOC pool of 1. ton. C/ha/yr in the root zone, can increase annual food production in developing countries by 24-32. million. tons of food grains and 6-10. million. tons of roots and tubers. The strategy is to create positive soil C and nutrient budgets through adoption of no-till farming with mulch, use of cover crops, integrated nutrient management including biofertilizers, water conservation, and harvesting, and improving soil structure and tilth. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {The relationship between long-term climate goals and short/medium-term emission targets forms crucial information for the design of international climate policy. Since IPCC's 4th Assessment Report (AR4), a large number of new scenario studies have been published. This paper reviews this new literature and finds that there is more flexibility in the timing of short-term emission reductions compared to the earlier scenarios assessed by the AR4. For instance, the current literature suggests that a peak of emissions in 2020 and even 2030 would be consistent with limiting temperature change to about 2°C in the long term. The timing when emissions peak depends on whether negative emissions in the long-term can be achieved. The recent scenarios further indicate that global emissions by 2050 should be 40–80{\%} below 2000 levels. Above all, the paper argues that there is no clear, single “law” that would directly determine the required emissions levels in 2020, but that instead policy-makers need to consider trade-offs between the likelihood of achieving long-term targets, the short-term costs, and their expectation with respect to future technologies (and their possible failure). The higher flexibility might be important in finding acceptable agreements on international climate policy.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Projections of future climate change play a fundamental role in improving understanding of the climate system as well as characterizing societal risks and response options. The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projection (CMIP6) that that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land-use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modelling, and impacts, adaptation and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the next IPCC assessment. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted scientific questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land-use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with climate model projections expected to be available within the 2018{\&}ndash;2020 time frame.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Lal2013,
abstract = {There is a strong link between food security and the carbon pool in terrestrial ecosystems, notably the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. Quantity and quality of the SOC pool are essential to soil quality, agronomic production, and use efficiency of inputs. Furthermore, limiting global warming to a 2°C increase in Earth's mean temperature requires the identification of appropriate sinks for atmospheric CO2. Sequestration of C in soils is almost an obvious climate solution, which ironically has been overlooked by policy makers. Yet, it is a proverbial "low-hanging" fruit with numerous co-benefits. Most soils of the agroecosystems are depleted of their antecedent SOC pool by 25{\%}-75{\%}, equivalent to 10-30 Mg/ha, which is also the technical sink capacity of C sequestration. The rate of SOC sequestration in soils of the tropics and subtropics is 100-500 kg/ha/year. The potential global soil C sink capacity is 1.2-3.1 Pg C/year, 25-50 years. While mitigating climate change, an increase in SOC pool also enhances crop yield because of improvements in soil physical (i.e., aggregation, available water capacity), chemical (i.e., cation and anion exchange capacity [CEC/AEC], soil reaction, nutrient transformation), and biological properties (i.e., microbial biomass C earthworm activity). The adoption of conservation-effective measures can avoid erosion-induced emissions by minimizing decomposition of SOC transported by erosional processes. The mean residence time of SOC depends on a range of exogenous and endogenous factors. Recommended management practices (RMPs) for SOC concentration include conservation agriculture based on no-till and mulch farming, use of cover crops and green manure, application of manure and biochar, and use of perennial culture, including agroforestry. Balanced application of fertilizers is crucial. Water conservation, water harvesting and recycling, use of drip subirrigation, and growing aerobic rice are some important practices for enhancing water-use efficiency. There is a strong need for research in understanding processes of SOC sequestration, identifying and validating soil-/site-specific agronomic practices, and making policy interventions that reward farmers through payments for ecosystem services. Farming C and trading C credits are needed to create another income stream for farmers and to promote the adoption of RMPs. Cropland soils of south Asia in general and those of the Indo-Gangetic Plain in particular are severely depleted of their SOC pool. Despite high inputs of fertilizers and water, crop yields are either stagnating or declining because of the ever-declining use efficiency of inputs (i.e., fertilizers, irrigation, high-yielding varieties) and degrading soils and water resources. A low SOC concentration of cropland soils (0.1{\%}-0.5{\%} in the plow layer of 0-20-cm depth) is the principal cause of decline in soil quality (e.g., low aggregation and plant available water capacity). Thus, RMPs that create a positive soil C budget and enhance the SOC pool must be identified. The balanced use of fertilizers and the application of farm yard manure and other biosolids (i.e., crop residues, green manure) are essential to SOC sequestration, improving the input-use efficiency, and increasing crop yields. There is a strong and positive correlation between the SOC pool in the root zone and the grain yield of wheat, maize, soybean, and other crops. The adoption of RMPs, which enhance SOC pools and sustain high agronomic yield, necessitates payments to farmers for providing ecosystem services through the trading of C credits and so on. Farming C is an important strategy to mitigate climate change, advance food security, and improve the environment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {World soils and terrestrial ecosystems have been a source of atmospheric abundance of CO2 ever since settled agriculture began about 10–13 mil- lennia ago. The amount of CO2-C emitted into the atmosphere is estimated at 136 ± 55 Pg from terres- trial ecosystems, of which emission from world soils is estimated at 78 ± 12 Pg. Conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems decreases soil organic carbon (SOC) pool by 30–50{\%} over 50–100 years in tem- perate regions, and 50–75{\%} over 20–50 years in tropical climates. The projected global warming, with estimated increase in mean annual temperature of 4–6°C by 2100, may have a profound impact on the total soil C pool and its dynamics. The SOC pool may increase due to increase in biomass production and accretion into the soil due to the so-called ‘‘CO2 fertilization effect'', which may also enhance pro- duction of the root biomass. Increase in weathering of silicates due to increase in temperature, and that of the formation of secondary carbonates due to increase in partial pressure of CO2 in soil air may also increase the total C pool. In contrast, however, SOC pool may decrease because of: (i) increase in rate of respiration and mineralization, (ii) increase in losses by soil erosion, and (iii) decrease in protective effects of stable aggregates which encapsulate organic matter. Furthermore, the relative increase in temperature projected to be more in arctic and boreal regions, will render Cryosols under permafrost from a net sink to a net source of CO2 if and when permafrost thaws. Thus, SOC pool of world soils may decrease with increase in mean global temperature. In contrast, the biotic pool may increase primarily because of the CO2 fertilization effect. The magnitude of CO2 fertilization effect may be constrained by lack of essential nutrients (e.g., N, P) and water. The potential of SOC sequestration in agricultural soils of Europe is 70–190 Tg C yr–1. This potential is realizable through adoption of recommended land use and management, and restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems including wetlands.},

Research dealing with adaptation, mitigation, risks, and vulnerability of global warming is comparatively small, but their share of papers increased exponentially since 2005. Research on vulnerability and on adaptation published the largest proportion of very important papers (in terms of citation impact). Cli-mate change research has become an issue also for disciplines beyond the natural sci-ences. The categories Engineering and Social Sciences show the strongest field-specific relative increase. The Journal of Geophysical Research, the Journal of Climate, the Geo-physical Research Letters, and Climatic Change appear at the top positions in terms of the total number of papers published. Research on climate change is quantitatively dominated by the USA, followed by the UK, Germany, and Canada. The citation-based indicators exhibit consistently that the UK has produced the largest proportion of high impact papers compared to the other countries (having published more than 10,000 papers). Also, Switzer-land, Denmark and also The Netherlands (with a publication output between around 3,000 and 6,000 papers) perform top—the impact of their contributions is on a high level. The title word analysis shows that the term climate change comes forward with time. Furthermore, the term impact arises and points to research dealing with the various effects of climate change. The discussion of the question of human induced climate change towards a clear fact (for the majority of the scientific community) stimulated research on future pathways for adaptation and mitigation. Finally, the term model and related terms prominently appear independent of time, indicating the high relevance of climate modeling.},

abstract = {Virtually all global energy forecasts include an expectation that bioenergy will be a substantial future energy source. However, the scale of this potential resource remains poorly understood because of uncertain land availability and yield expectations. Here, we used climate-constrained, satellite-derived net primary productivity data computed for 110 million square kilometers of terrestrial plant production as an upper-envelope constraint on primary bioenergy potential (PBP). We estimated the maximum PBP to realistically range from 12{\%} to 35{\%} of 2009 global primary energy consumption, with yield potential ranging from 6.6 to 18.8 megajoules per square meter per year—roughly four times lower than previous evaluations. Our results highlight many recent bioenergy evaluations as overoptimistic, which we attribute to a failure to adequately apply biophysical constraints in estimates of yield potential. We do not advocate bioenergy production at the levels reported in this analysis; instead, we simply report the ceiling for PBP based on current planetary productivity.},

abstract = {Limiting climate change to 2 °C with a high probability requires reducing cumulative emissions to about 1600 GtCO2 over the 2000–2100 period. This requires unprecedented rates of decarbonization even in the short-run. The availability of the option of net negative emissions, such as bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or reforestation/afforestation, allows to delay some of these emission reductions. In the paper, we assess the demand and potential for negative emissions in particular from BECCS. Both stylized calculations and model runs show that without the possibility of negative emissions, pathways meeting the 2 °C target with high probability need almost immediate emission reductions or simply become infeasible. The potential for negative emissions is uncertain. We show that negative emissions from BECCS are probably limited to around 0 to 10 GtCO2/year in 2050 and 0 to 20 GtCO2/year in 2100. Estimates on the potential of afforestation options are in the order of 0–4 GtCO2/year. Given the importance and the uncertainty concerning BECCS, we stress the importance of near-term assessments of its availability as today's decisions has important consequences for climate change mitigation in the long run.},

abstract = {Bioenergy deployment offers significant potential for climate change mitigation, but also carries considerable risks. In this review, we bring together perspectives of various communities involved in the research and regulation of bioenergy deployment in the context of climate change mitigation: Land-use and energy experts, landuse and integrated assessment modelers, human geographers, ecosystem researchers, climate scientists and two different strands of life-cycle assessment experts. We summarize technological options, outline the state-of-theart knowledge on various climate effects, provide an update on estimates of technical resource potential and comprehensively identify sustainability effects. Cellulosic feedstocks, increased end-use efficiency, improved land carbon-stock management and residue use, and, when fully developed, BECCS appear as the most promising options, depending on development costs, implementation, learning, and risk management. Combined heat and power, efficient biomass cookstoves and small-scale power generation for rural areas can help to promote energy access and sustainable development, along with reduced emissions. We estimate the sustainable technical potential as up to 100 EJ: high agreement; 100–300 EJ: medium agreement; above 300 EJ: low agreement. Stabilization scenarios indicate that bioenergy may supply from 10 to 245 EJ yr 1 to global primary energy supply by 2050. Models indicate that, if technological and governance preconditions are met, large-scale deployment ({\textgreater}200 EJ), together with BECCS, could help to keep global warming below 2° degrees of preindustrial levels; but such high deployment of land-intensive bioenergy feedstocks could also lead to detrimental climate effects, negatively impact ecosystems, biodiversity and livelihoods. The integration of bioenergy systems into agriculture and forest landscapes can improve land and water use efficiency and help address concerns about environmental impacts. We conclude that the high variability in pathways, uncertainties in technological development and ambiguity in political decision render forecasts on deployment levels and climate effects very difficult. However, uncertainty about projections should not preclude pursuing beneficial bioenergy options.},

Owing to the scale and rate of CO2 production compared to that of utilization allowing long-term sequestration, it is highly improbable the chemical conversion of CO2 will account for more than 1{\%} of the mitigation challenge, and even a scaled-up enhanced oil recovery (EOR)-CCS industry will likely only account for 4-8{\%}. Therefore, whilst CO2-EOR may be an important economic incentive for some early CCS projects, CCU may prove to be a costly distraction, financially and politically, from the real task of mitigation.},

Here, we review how competition for land is influenced by other drivers and pressures, examine land-use change over the past 20 years and consider future changes over the next 40 years. Competition for land, in itself, is not a driver affecting food and farming in the future, but is an emergent property of other drivers and pressures. Modelling studies suggest that future policy decisions in the agriculture, forestry, energy and conservation sectors could have profound effects, with different demands for land to supply multiple ecosystem services usually intensifying competition for land in the future. In addition to policies addressing agriculture and food production, further policies addressing the primary drivers of competition for land (population growth, dietary preference, protected areas, forest policy) could have significant impacts in reducing competition for land. Technologies for increasing per-area productivity of agricultural land will also be necessary. Key uncertainties in our projections of competition for land in the future relate predominantly to uncertainties in the drivers and pressures within the scenarios, in the models and data used in the projections and in the policy interventions assumed to affect the drivers and pressures in the future.},

Relevant science has advanced in areas such as chemical engineering, geophysics, and social psychology. Governments have generously funded demonstrations. As a result, a handful of industrial-scale CCS projects are currently injecting about 15 megatons of CO2 underground annually that contribute to climate change mitigation. However, CCS is struggling to gain a foothold in the set of options for dealing with climate change. This review explores why and discusses critical conditions for CCS to emerge as a viable mitigation option. Explanations for this struggle include the absence of government action on climate change, economic crisis–induced low carbon prices, public skepticism, increasing costs, and advances in other options including renewables and shale gas.

abstract = {It is physically possible to capture CO2 directly from the air and immobilize it in geological structures. Air capture differs from conventional mitigation in three key aspects. First, it removes emissions from any part of the economy with equal ease or difficulty, so its cost provides an absolute cap on the cost of mitigation. Second, it permits reduction in concentrations faster than the natural carbon cycle: the effects of irreversibility are thus partly alleviated. Third, because it is weakly coupled to existing energy infrastructure, air capture may offer stronger economies of scale and smaller adjustment costs than the more conventional mitigation technologies.},

abstract = {When assessing soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and its climate change (CC) mitigation potential at global scale, the dynamic nature of soil carbon storage and interventions to foster it should be taken into account. Firstly, adoption of SOC-sequestration measures will take time, and reasonably such schemes could only be implemented gradually at large-scale. Secondly, if soils are managed as carbon sinks, then SOC will increase only over a limited time, up to the point when a new SOC equilibrium is reached. This paper combines these two processes and predicts potential SOC sequestration dynamics in agricultural land at global scale and the corresponding CC mitigation potential. Assuming that global governments would agree on a worldwide effort to gradually change land use practices towards turning agricultural soils into carbon sinks starting 2014, the projected 87-year (2014-2100) global SOC sequestration potential of agricultural land ranged between 31 and 64 Gt. This is equal to 1.9-3.9{\%} of the SRES-A2 projected 87-year anthropogenic emissions. SOC sequestration would peak 2032-33, at that time reaching 4.3-8.9{\%} of the projected annual SRES-A2 emission. About 30 years later the sequestration rate would have reduced by half. Thus, SOC sequestration is not a C wedge that could contribute increasingly to mitigating CC. Rather, the mitigation potential is limited, contributing very little to solving the climate problem of the coming decades. However, we deliberately did not elaborate on the importance of maintaining or increasing SOC for sustaining soil health, agro-ecosystem functioning and productivity; an issue of global significance that deserves proper consideration irrespectively of any potential additional sequestration of SOC. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Coal combustion residues account for 90{\~{}} of all fossil fuel com- bustion wastes produced in the USA. It is projected that by the year 2000 more than 150 million t of these materials will be produced in the USA each year. Presently, only about 2{\{}W/{\~{}} of these wastes are utilized, with the remainder deposited in landfills or surface impound. ments. This article reviews the information available concerning the environmental impacts associated with the disposal or utilization of coal combustion residues. The majority of the information available in the literature concerns the impacts of fly and bottom ashes; other coal combustion wastes have not received much attention. The major potential impacts of ash disposal on terrestrial ecosystems include: leaching of potentially toxic substances into soils and groundwater; reductions in plant establishment and growth due primarily to adverse chemical characteristics of the ash; changes in the elemental compo- sition of vegetation growing on the ash; and increased mobility and accumulation of potentially toxic elements throughout the food chain. Ash disposal in landfills and settling ponds can influence adjacent aquatic ecosystems directly, through inputs of ash basin effluent and surface runoff, and indirectly, through seepage and groundwater con- tamination. Major impacts are generally associated with changes in water chemistry, including changes in pH and concentrations of po- tentially toxic elements. Using ash as a soil amendment can improve soil texture and water-holding capacity, increase soil pH, and enhance soil fertility. However, it may also result in excessive soluble salt con- centrations, excess B, and increased concentrations of other poten- tially toxic trace elements; reduction in the concentrations and/or availability of soil N and P; elemental imbalances due to excessively high pH; and cementation or compaction of soil. Scrubber sludge and fiuidized bed combustion waste may be used as soil amendments as well, but also may create problems due to high alkalinity and high salinity.}},

abstract = {The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion is contributing to recent climate change which is among the major challenges facing the world. Agroforestry systems can contribute to slowing down those increases and, thus, contribute to climate change mitigation. Agroforestry refers to the production of crop, livestock, and tree biomass on the same area of land. The soil organic carbon (SOC) pool, in particular, is the only terrestrial pool storing some carbon (C) for millennia which can be deliberately enhanced by agroforestry practices. Up to 2.2 Pg C (1 Pg = 1015 g) may be sequestered above- and belowground over 50 years in agroforestry systems, but estimations on global land area occupied by agroforestry systems are particularly uncertain. Global areas under tree intercropping, multistrata systems, protective systems, silvopasture, and tree woodlots are estimated at 700, 100, 300, 450, and 50 Mha, respectively. The SOC storage in agroforestry systems is also uncertain and may amount up to 300 Mg C ha−1 to 1 m depth. Here, we review and synthesize the current knowledge about SOC sequestration processes and their management in agroforestry systems. The main points are that (1) useful C sequestration in agroforestry systems for climate change mitigation must slow or even reverse the increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 by storing some SOC for millennia, (2) soil disturbance must be minimized and tree species with a high root biomass-to-aboveground biomass ratio and/or nitrogen-fixing trees planted when SOC sequestration is among the objectives for establishing the agroforestry system, (3) sequestration rates and the processes contributing to the stabilization of SOC in agroforestry soils need additional data and research, (4) retrospective studies are often missing for rigorous determination of SOC and accurate evaluation of effects of different agroforestry practices on SOC sequestration in soil profiles, and (5) the long-term SOC storage is finite as it depends on the availability of binding sites, i.e., the soil's mineral composition and depth. Based on this improved knowledge, site-specific SOC sequestering agroforestry practices can then be developed.},

abstract = {The chemical weathering of rocks currently absorbs about 1.1 Gt CO2 a−1 being mainly stored as bicarbonate in the ocean. An enhancement of this slow natural process could remove substantial amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere, aiming to offset some unavoidable anthropogenic emissions in order to comply with the Paris Agreement, while at the same time it may decrease ocean acidification. We provide the first comprehensive assessment of economic costs, energy requirements, technical parameterization, and global and regional carbon removal potential. The crucial parameters defining this potential are the grain size and weathering rates. The main uncertainties about the potential relate to weathering rates and rock mass that can be integrated into the soil. The discussed results do not specifically address the enhancement of weathering through microbial processes, feedback of geogenic nutrient release, and bioturbation. We do not only assess dunite rock, predominantly bearing olivine (in the form of forsterite) as the mineral that has been previously proposed to be best suited for carbon removal, but focus also on basaltic rock to minimize potential negative side effects. Our results show that enhanced weathering is an option for carbon dioxide removal that could be competitive already at 60 US {\$} t−1 CO2 removed for dunite, but only at 200 US {\$} t−1 CO2 removed for basalt. The potential carbon removal on cropland areas could be as large as 95 Gt CO2 a−1 for dunite and 4.9 Gt CO2 a−1 for basalt. The best suited locations are warm and humid areas, particularly in India, Brazil, South-East Asia and China, where almost 75{\%} of the global potential can be realized. This work presents a techno-economic assessment framework, which also allows for the incorporation of further processes.},

Agricultural practices can make a significant contribution at low cost to increasing soil carbon sinks, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contributing biomass feedstocks for energy use. Considering all gases, the global technical mitigation potential from agriculture (excluding fossil fuel offsets from biomass) by 2030 is estimated to be ca. 5500–6000 Mt CO2-eq. yr−1. Economic potentials are estimated to be 1500–1600, 2500–2700 and 4000–4300 Mt CO2-eq. yr−1 at carbon prices of up to {\$}US20, 50 and 100 t CO2-eq.−1, respectively. The value of the global agricultural GHG mitigation at the same three carbon prices is {\$}US32 000, 130 000 and 420 000 million yr−1, respectively. At the European level, early estimates of soil carbon sequestration potential in croplands were ca. 200 Mt CO2 yr−1, but this is a technical potential and is for geographical Europe as far east as the Urals. The economic potential is much smaller, with more recent estimates for the EU27 suggesting a maximum potential of ca. 20 Mt CO2-eq. yr−1. The UK is small in global terms, but a large part of its land area (11 Mha) is used for agriculture. Agriculture accounts for about 7{\%} of total UK GHG emissions. The mitigation potential of UK agriculture is estimated to be ca. 1–2 Mt CO2-eq. yr−1, accounting for less than 1{\%} of UK total GHG emissions.},

abstract = {This study explores the importance of bioenergy to potential future energy transformation and climate change management. Using a large inter-model comparison of 15 models, we comprehensively characterize and analyze future dependence on, and the value of, bioenergy in achieving potential long-run climate objectives. Model scenarios project, by 2050, bioenergy growth of 1 to 10 {\%} per annum reaching 1 to 35 {\%} of global primary energy, and by 2100, bioenergy becoming 10 to 50 {\%} of global primary energy. Non-OECD regions are projected to be the dominant suppliers of biomass, as well as consumers, with up to 35 {\%} of regional electricity from biopower by 2050, and up to 70 {\%} of regional liquid fuels from biofuels by 2050. Bioenergy is found to be valuable to many models with significant implications for mitigation and macroeconomic costs of climate policies. The availability of bioenergy, in particular biomass with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS), notably affects the cost-effective global emissions trajectory for climate management by accommodating prolonged near-term use of fossil fuels, but with potential implications for climate outcomes. Finally, we find that models cost-effectively trade-off land carbon and nitrous oxide emissions for the long-run climate change management benefits of bioenergy. The results suggest opportunities, but also imply challenges. Overall, further evaluation of the viability of large-scale global bioenergy is merited.},

The SRREN made considerable progress in bringing together contrasting views on indirect land-use change from inductive bottom-up studies, such as life-cycle analysis, and deductive top-down assessments.

It is therefore an urgent question to what extent CDR will be needed to implement the long term ambition of the Paris Agreement. Here we show that ambitious near term mitigation significantly decreases CDR requirements to keep the Paris climate targets within reach. Following the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) until 2030 makes 2 °C unachievable without CDR. Reducing 2030 emissions by 20{\%} below NDC levels alleviates the trade-off between high transitional challenges and high CDR deployment. Nevertheless, transitional challenges increase significantly if CDR is constrained to less than 5 Gt CO2 a−1 in any year. At least 8 Gt CO2 a−1 CDR are necessary in the long term to achieve 1.5 °C and more than 15 Gt CO2 a−1 to keep transitional challenges in bounds.},

abstract = {Enhancing global bioenergy production intimately relates to food production and food security. Here we present a scoping study that aims to explore the interlinkages of bioenergy and food production at the global scale. On the basis of a food-first approach, that is, calculating bioenergy potentials for 2050 only on land that is not needed for food or feed production, we consistently integrated existing mainstream scenarios of the development of food demand and agricultural technology for 2050 in a biophysical biomass-balance model. This balance model is built from highly detailed consistent biophysical databases and combines four different assumptions on yield developments and two on cropland expansion with four assumptions on diets and two on feeding efficiencies of livestock. Out of the possible 64 scenario combinations, 43 were found to be “feasible,” that is, biomass required to match the respective food, fiber, and feed demand could be met with the assumed cropland area and yields. For all feasible scenarios, three components of the global primary bioenergy potential were calculated: (1) bioenergy from crop residues, (2) bioenergy from dedicated crop plantations on land available within the agricultural scenarios, and (3) bioenergy available after assuming an intensification of high-quality grazing land and cultivation of the set-free area. Deforestation and bioenergy from forestry were not considered in this top-down approach. Global primary bioenergy potentials were found to range from 58 to 178 EJ/yr, resulting in a global biofuel potential of 9–53 EJ/yr. The range of results mainly depends on diets; richer diets were associated with lower bioenergy potentials and vice versa. The bioenergy potential grows with growing cropland yields and feeding efficiency. The lion's share of this bioenergy potential is found in developing countries, in particular Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. The realization of these potentials, however, will be associated with far-reaching transformations of the land systems in these regions, with a high risk of reducing food security. {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2012.},

abstract = {Based on a large number of energy-economic and integrated assessment models, the Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) 27 study systematically explores the implications of technology cost and availability for feasibility and macroeconomic costs of energy system transformations toward climate stabilization. At the highest level, the technology strategy articulated in all the scenarios in EMF27 includes three elements: decarbonization of energy supply, increasing the use of low-carbon energy carriers in end-use, and reduction of energy use. The way that the scenarios differ is in the degree to which these different elements of strategy are implemented, the timing of those implementations, and the associated macroeconomic costs. The study also discusses the value of individual technologies for achieving climate stabilization. A robust finding is that the unavailability of carbon capture and storage and limited availability of bioenergy have the largest impact on feasibility and macroeconomic costs for stabilizing atmospheric concentrations at low levels, mostly because of their combined ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Constraining options in the electric sector such as nuclear power, wind and solar energy in contrast has a much smaller impact on the cost of mitigation.},

abstract = {Recent controversy has led to calls for increased standardization and transparency in the methods used to synthesize climate change research. Though these debates have focused largely on the biophysical dimen- sions of climate change, human dimensions research is equally in need of improved methodological approaches for research synthesis. Systematic review approaches, and more recently realist review methods, have been used within the health sciences for decades to guide research synthesis. Despite this, penetration of these approaches into the social and environmental sciences has been limited. Here, we present an analysis of approaches for systematic review and research synthesis and examine their applica- bility in an adaptation context. Customized review frame- works informed by systematic approaches to research synthesis provide a conceptually appropriate and practical opportunity for increasing methodological transparency and rigor in synthesizing and tracking adaptation research. This review highlights innovative applications of system- atic approaches, with a focus on the unique challenges of integrating multiple data sources and formats in reviewing climate change adaptation policy and practice. We present guidelines, key considerations, and recommendations for systematic review in the social sciences in general and adaptation research in particular. We conclude by calling for increased conceptual and methodological development of systematic review approaches to address the methodo- logical challenges of synthesizing and tracking adaptation to climate change.},

It is therefore an urgent question to what extent CDR will be needed to implement the long term ambition of the Paris Agreement. Here we show that ambitious near term mitigation significantly decreases CDR requirements to keep the Paris climate targets within reach. Following the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) until 2030 makes 2 °C unachievable without CDR. Reducing 2030 emissions by 20{\%} below NDC levels alleviates the trade-off between high transitional challenges and high CDR deployment. Nevertheless, transitional challenges increase significantly if CDR is constrained to less than 5 Gt CO 2 a −1 in any year. At least 8 Gt CO 2 a −1 CDR are necessary in the long term to achieve 1.5 °C and more than 15 Gt CO 2 a −1 to keep transitional challenges in bounds.},

However, synthesizing policy insights from the urban literature is a challenge, due to its rapid growth, breadth of topics and relative lack of assessments so far. Here we introduce methods from computational linguistics to build a systematic overview of research on transport, buildings, waste management and urban form. We find that the epistemic core of the mitigation-focused urban literature is currently centered on urban form and emissions accounting, while extensive research into demand-side options remain overlooked, including congestion and parking polices, active travel, and waste management. In the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 °C, and for meeting the target itself, all such city-scale opportunities need to be examined.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Centre for Economic Policy Research. All rights reserved. With very high risk of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts globally due to unabated anthropogenic climate change, we argue in this chapter that the 2°C limit can be justified by the synthesis of available scientific evidence as an application of the precautionary principle. In principle, the risks of mitigation differ fundamentally from the risks of climate change in terms of their nature, timescale, magnitude and persistence. Humankind has the technological means to solve the problem. However, the challenges of stringent mitigation action are enormous and have been increasing over the last decade because of the ongoing renaissance of coal, which does not allow for a decoupling of economic and population growth from emissions. Keeping a greater than 66{\%} probability of staying below the 2°C limit, for example, would require current emission levels to be reduced by 40-70{\%} by 2050, and emission levels of zero and below by the end of the 21st century. This requires a large-scale transformation in the way we produce and use energy, as well as how we use land. The most fundamental challenges are the oversupply of fossil fuels and the risks associated with negative emissions technologies, or high bioenergy deployment. A further delay in mitigation action substantially increases the difficulty of, and narrows the options for, this transformation. Delays are associated with a growing dependence on negative emissions technologies as well as higher mitigation costs in the long run. In the near term, a fundamental departure from the business-as-usual development is required. Therefore, triggering short-term climate policy action is instrumental for any reasonable long-term climate goal. While the institutional challenges are tantamount, there are multiple rationales for pricing carbon and introducing complementary policies.},

abstract = {On the basis of the IPCC B2, A1b and B1 baseline scenarios, mitigation scenarios were developed that stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations at 650, 550 and 450 and – subject to specific assumptions – 400 ppm CO2-eq. The analysis takes into account a large number of reduction options, such as reductions of non-CO2 gases, carbon plantations and measures in the energy system. The study shows stabilization as low as 450 ppm CO2-eq. to be technically feasible, even given relatively high baseline scenarios. To achieve these lower concentration levels, global emissions need to peak within the first two decades. The net present value of abatement costs for the B2 baseline scenario (a medium scenario) increases from 0.2{\%} of cumulative GDP to 1.1{\%} as the shift is made from 650 to 450 ppm. On the other hand, the probability of meeting a two-degree target increases from 0{\%}–10{\%} to 20{\%}–70{\%}. The mitigation scenarios lead to lower emissions of regional air pollutants but also to increased land use. The uncertainty in the cost estimates is at least in the order of 50{\%}, with the most important uncertainties including land-use emissions, the potential for bio-energy and the contribution of energy efficiency. Furthermore, creating the right socio-economic and political conditions for mitigation is more important than any of the technical constraints.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of combining CO2 capture and storage with alternative systems for biomass-based combined heat and power production (CHP) in Kraft pulp and paper mills. We compare heat, power, and CO2 balances of systems with alternative configurations of the CHP and CO2-capture systems. Because the captured CO2 comes from renewable biomass, the studied systems yield negative CO2 emissions. It is shown that pulp mills and integrated pulp and paper mills have the potential to become net exporters of biomass-based electricity while at the same time removing CO2 from the atmosphere on a net basis. The study shows that that the overall best CO2 abatement is achieved when CO2 capture is carried out within a biomass integrated gasifier with combined cycle where the syngas undergoes a CO-shift reaction. This configuration combines efficient energy conversion with a high CO2 capture efficiency. Furthermore, cost curves are constructed, which show how the cost of CO2 capture and storage in pulp and paper mills depends on system configuration and the CO2 transportation distance. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Sentiment Analysis is the task of automatically identifying whether a text or a single sentence is intended to carry a positive or negative connotation. The commonly used Bag-of-Words approach that relies on counting positive and negative words, whose connotation is indicated by specially crafted sentiment dictionaries, is not ideal because it does not take into account the relations between words and how the connotation of single words changes according to the context. This paper proposes a way of identifying and analysing the targets of the opinions and their modifiers, along with their linkage (appraisal group) through an annotation schema called SentiML. Such schema has been developed in order to facilitate the identification of these elements and the annotation of their sentiment, along with advanced linguistic features such as their appraisal type according to the Appraisal Framework. The schema is XML-based and has been also designed to be language-independent. Preliminary results show that the schema allows more coverage than a sentiment dictionary, while achieving reasonably fast and reliable annotation in spite of its fine granularity.},

Enhanced terrestrial uptake of CO2 over the next 50 to 100 years has been suggested as a way to reclaim the 150 or more Pg carbon (C) lost to the atmosphere from vegetation and soil since 1850 as a consequence of land use change (Batjes, 1999; Lal et al., 1998a; Houghton, 1995), thus effectively `buying time' for the development and implementation of new longer term technical solutions, such as C-free fuels. The ultimate potential for terrestrial C sequestration is not known, however, because we lack adequate understanding of (1) the biogeochemical mechanisms responsible for C fluxes and storage potential on the molecular, landscape, regional, and global scales, and (2) the complex genetic and physiological processes controlling key biological and ecological phenomena. Specifically, the structure and dynamics of the belowground component of terrestrial carbon pools, which accounts for two-thirds of global terrestrial organic C stocks, is poorly understood. Focusing primarily on forests, croplands and grasslands, the purpose of this chapter is to consider innovative technology for enhancing C sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems and address the scientific issues related to better understanding of soil C sequestration potential through appropriate and effective approaches to ecosystem management.},

For each option, we discuss its effectiveness and potential side effects, also considering lifetime of effect, development and deployment timescale, reversibility, and failure risks. We present a detailed review that builds on earlier work by including the most recent literature, and is more extensive than previous comparative frameworks. Solar radiation management propsals are most effective but short-lived, whilst carbon dioxide removal measures gain effectiveness the longer they are pursued. Solar radiation management could restore the global radiative balance, but must be maintained to avoid abrupt warming, meanwhile ocean acidification and residual regional climate changes would still occur. Carbon dioxide removal involves less risk, and offers a way to return to a pre-industrial CO(2) level and climate on a millennial timescale, but is potentially limited by the CO(2) storage capacity of geological reservoirs. Geoengineering could complement mitigation, but it is not an alternative to it. We expand on the possible combinations of mitigation, carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management that might be used to avoid dangerous climate change.},

Integrated model studies highlight that climate policies as part of well-designed policy packages reduce the overall cost of achieving multiple sustainability objectives. The incommensurability and uncertainties around the quantification of coeffects become, however, increasingly pervasive the more the perspective shifts from sectoral and local to economy wide and global, the more objectives are analyzed, and the more the results are expressed in economic rather than nonmonetary terms. Different strings of evidence highlight the role and importance of energy demand reductions for realizing synergies across multiple sustainability objectives.},

abstract = {Drawing on large-scale computational data and methods, this research demonstrates how polarization efforts are influenced by a patterned network of political and financial actors. These dynamics, which have been notoriously difficult to quantify, are illustrated here with a computational analysis of climate change politics in the United States. The comprehensive data include all individual and organizational actors in the climate change countermovement (164 organizations), as well as all written and verbal texts produced by this network between 1993–2013 (40,785 texts, more than 39 million words). Two main findings emerge. First, that organizations with corporate funding were more likely to have written and disseminated texts meant to polarize the climate change issue. Second, and more importantly, that corporate funding influences the actual thematic content of these polarization efforts, and the discursive prevalence of that thematic content over time. These findings provide new, and comprehensive, confirmation of dynamics long thought to be at the root of climate change politics and discourse. Beyond the specifics of climate change, this paper has important implications for understanding ideological polarization more generally, and the increasing role of private funding in determining why certain polarizing themes are created and amplified. Lastly, the paper suggests that future studies build on the novel approach taken here that integrates large-scale textual analysis with social networks. },

abstract = {The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the new international climate treaty could put 2015 into the history books as a defining year for setting human development on a more sustainable pathway. The global climate policy and SDG agendas are highly interconnected: the way that the climate problem is addressed strongly affects the prospects of meeting numerous other SDGs and vice versa. Drawing on existing scenario results from a recent energy-economy-climate model inter-comparison project, this letter analyses these synergies and (risk) trade-offs of alternative 2 °C pathways across indicators relevant for energy-related SDGs and sustainable energy objectives. We find that limiting the availability of key mitigation technologies yields some co-benefits and decreases risks specific to these technologies but greatly increases many others. Fewer synergies and substantial trade-offs across SDGs are locked into the system for weak short-term climate policies that are broadly in line with current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), particularly when combined with constraints on technologies. Lowering energy demand growth is key to managing these trade-offs and creating synergies across multiple energy-related SD dimensions. We argue that SD considerations are central for choosing socially acceptable 2 °C pathways: the prospects of meeting other SDGs need not dwindle and can even be enhanced for some goals if appropriate climate policy choices are made. Progress on the climate policy and SDG agendas should therefore be tracked within a unified framework.},

abstract = {This chapter presents the results that indicate a large and variably distributed North American storage capacity of at least 3,800 gigatones of carbon dioxide (GtCO2), with deep saline formations accounting for the majority of this capacity. A geospatial and techno-economic database of 2,082 anthropogenic CO2 point sources in North America, each with annual emissions greater than 100,000 tones of CO2, was also refined. By computing a series of pairwise cost-minimizing decisions for these CO2 sources and potential geological-storage reservoirs, a CO2-storage cost curve for North America was calculated that includes the cost of transporting CO2 from the plant gate to a selected storage reservoir, the cost of injecting it into the underground formation, and any offsetting revenue associated with resulting enhanced hydrocarbon recovery, yielding a classic, positively sloping supply curve. Sensitivities examined for this CO2-storage cost curve focus on: high/low oil and gas prices; the maximum allowed distance between source and reservoir; and, for storage in value-added reservoirs, the infrastructure costs associated with CO2-driven hydrocarbon recovery. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The limitations of traditional forms of systematic review in making optimal use of all forms of evidence are increasingly evident, especially for policy-makers and practitioners. There is an urgent need for robust ways of incorporating qualitative evidence into systematic reviews. OBJECTIVES: In this paper we provide a brief overview and critique of a selection of strategies for synthesising qualitative and quantitative evidence, ranging from techniques that are largely qualitative and interpretive through to techniques that are largely quantitative and integrative. RESULTS: A range of methods is available for synthesising diverse forms of evidence. These include narrative summary, thematic analysis, grounded theory, meta-ethnography, meta-study, realist synthesis, Miles and Huberman's data analysis techniques, content analysis, case survey, qualitative comparative analysis and Bayesian meta-analysis. Methods vary in their strengths and weaknesses, ability to deal with qualitative and quantitative forms of evidence, and type of question for which they are most suitable. CONCLUSIONS: We identify a number of procedural, conceptual and theoretical issues that need to be addressed in moving forward with this area, and emphasise the need for existing techniques to be evaluated and modified, rather than inventing new approaches.},

abstract = {Several methods exist to estimate the cumulative carbon emissions that would keep global warming to below a given temperature limit. Here we review estimates reported by the IPCC and the recent literature, and discuss the reasons underlying their differences. The most scientifically robust number [mdash] the carbon budget for CO2-induced warming only [mdash] is also the least relevant for real-world policy. Including all greenhouse gases and using methods based on scenarios that avoid instead of exceed a given temperature limit results in lower carbon budgets. For a {\textgreater}66{\%} chance of limiting warming below the internationally agreed temperature limit of 2 [deg]C relative to pre-industrial levels, the most appropriate carbon budget estimate is 590-1,240 GtCO2 from 2015 onwards. Variations within this range depend on the probability of staying below 2 [deg]C and on end-of-century non-CO2 warming. Current CO2 emissions are about 40 GtCO2 yr-1, and global CO2 emissions thus have to be reduced urgently to keep within a 2 [deg]C-compatible budget.},

We argue, however, that the amounts of SOC potentially sequestered in both scenarios (pessimistic and optimistic) fulfil the requirements for being considered as wedge because in both cases at least 25 GtC would be sequestered during the next 50 years. We consider that it is precisely in the near future, and meanwhile other solutions are developed, when this stabilization effort is most urgent even if after some decades the sequestration rate is significantly reduced. Indirect effects of SOC sequestration on mitigation could reinforce the potential of this solution. We conclude that the sequestration of organic carbon in agricultural soils as a climate change mitigation tool still deserves important attention for scientists, managers and policy makers.},

The study assumes early actions and quantifies the market penetration of low carbon technologies, the emission pathways and the economic costs for an efficient reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions such that the temperature limit is not exceeded. We evaluate the potential role of direct air capture (DAC) and its impact on policy costs and energy consumption. DAC is a technology that removes emissions directly from the atmosphere contributing to negative carbon emissions. We find that, with our modelling assumptions, limiting global temperature to 1.5 °C is only possible when using DAC. Our results show that the DAC technology can play an important role in realising deep decarbonisation goals and in the reduction of regional and global mitigation costs with stringent targets. DAC acts a substitute to Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) in the stringent scenarios. For this analysis, we use the model MERGE-ETL, a technology-rich integrated assessment model with endogenous learning.},

abstract = {Climate policy needs to account for political and social acceptance. Current national climate policy plans proposed under the Paris Agreement lead to higher emissions until 2030 than cost-effective pathways towards the Agreements' long-term temperature goals would imply. Therefore, the current plans would require highly disruptive changes , prohibitive transition speeds, and very large long-term deployment of risky mitigation measures for achieving the Agreement's temperature goals after 2030. Since the prospects of introducing the cost-effective policy instrument, a global comprehensive carbon price, in the near-term are negligible, we study how a strengthening of existing plans by a global roll-out of regional policies can ease the implementation challenge of reaching the Paris temperature goals. The regional policies comprise a bundle of regulatory policies in energy supply, transport, buildings, industry, and land use and moderate, regionally differentiated carbon pricing. We find that a global roll-out of these policies could reduce global CO2 emissions by an additional 10 GtCO2eq in 2030 compared to current plans. It would lead to emissions pathways close to the levels of cost-effective well below 2°C and 1.5°C scenarios until 2030, thereby reducing implementation challenges post 2030. Even though a gradual phase-in of a portfolio of regulatory policies might be less disruptive than immediate cost-effective carbon pricing, it would perform worse in other dimensions. In particular, it leads to higher economic impacts that could become major obstacles in the long term. Hence, such policy packages should not be viewed as alternatives to carbon pricing, but rather as complements that provide entry points to achieve the Paris climate goals.},

The global atmospheric CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth ({\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}ATM{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) is computed from the annual changes in concentration.

For the last decade available (2007–2016), {\textless}i{\textgreater}E{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}FF{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} was 9.4 ± 0.5 GtC yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}E{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}LUC{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} 1.3 ± 0.7 GtC yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}ATM{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} 4.7 ± 0.1 GtC yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}OCEAN{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} 2.4 ± 0.5 GtC yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}LAND{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} 3.0 ± 0.8 GtC yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, with a budget imbalance {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}IM{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} of 0.6 GtC yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} indicating overestimated emissions and/or underestimated sinks. For year 2016 alone, the growth in {\textless}i{\textgreater}E{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}FF{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} was approximately zero and emissions remained at 9.9 ± 0.5 GtC yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. Also for 2016, {\textless}i{\textgreater}E{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}LUC{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} was 1.3 ± 0.7 GtC yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}ATM{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} was 6.1 ± 0.2 GtC yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}OCEAN{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} was 2.6 ± 0.5 GtC yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}LAND{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} was 2.7 ± 1.0 GtC yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, with a small {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}IM{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} of −0.3 GtC. {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}ATM{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} continued to be higher in 2016 compared to the past decade (2007–2016), reflecting in part the high fossil emissions and the small {\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}LAND{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} consistent with El Ni{\~{n}}o conditions. The global atmospheric CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} concentration reached 402.8 ± 0.1 ppm averaged over 2016. For 2017, preliminary data for the first 6–9 months indicate a renewed growth in {\textless}i{\textgreater}E{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}FF{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} of +2.0 {\%} (range of 0.8 to 3.0 {\%}) based on national emissions projections for China, USA, and India, and projections of gross domestic product (GDP) corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world.

abstract = {We describe an approach to CO2 capture and storage from the atmosphere that involves enhancing the solubility of CO2 in the ocean by a process equivalent to the natural silicate weathering reaction. HCl is electrochemically removed from the ocean and neutralized through reaction with silicate rocks. The increase in ocean alkalinity resulting from the removal of HCl causes atmospheric CO2 to dissolve into the ocean where it will be stored primarily as HCO3− without further acidifying the ocean. On timescales of hundreds of years or longer, some of the additional alkalinity will likely lead to precipitation or enhanced preservation of CaCO3, resulting in the permanent storage of the associated carbon, and the return of an equal amount of carbon to the atmosphere. Whereas the natural silicate weathering process is effected primarily by carbonic acid, the engineered process accelerates the weathering kinetics to industrial rates by replacing this weak acid with HCl.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd. Meeting the 1.5 °C goal will require a rapid scale-up of zero-carbon energy supply, fuel switching to electricity, efficiency and demand-reduction in all sectors, and the replenishment of natural carbon sinks. These transformations will have immediate impacts on various of the sustainable development goals. As goals such as affordable and clean energy and zero hunger are more immediate to great parts of global population, these impacts are central for societal acceptability of climate policies. Yet, little is known about how the achievement of other social and environmental sustainability objectives can be directly managed through emission reduction policies. In addition, the integrated assessment literature has so far emphasized a single, global (cost-minimizing) carbon price as the optimal mechanism to achieve emissions reductions. In this paper we introduce a broader suite of policies - including direct sector-level regulation, early mitigation action, and lifestyle changes - into the integrated energy-economy-land-use modeling system REMIND-MAgPIE. We examine their impact on non-climate sustainability issues when mean warming is to be kept well below 2 °C or 1.5 °C. We find that a combination of these policies can alleviate air pollution, water extraction, uranium extraction, food and energy price hikes, and dependence on negative emissions technologies, thus resulting in substantially reduced sustainability risks associated with mitigating climate change. Importantly, we find that these targeted policies can more than compensate for most sustainability risks of increasing climate ambition from 2 °C to 1.5 °C.},

abstract = {The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals provide guide-posts to society as it attempts to respond to an array of pressing challenges. One of these challenges is energy; thus, the SDGs have become paramount for energy policy-making. Yet, while governments throughout the world have already declared the SDGs to be “integrated and indivisible”, there are still knowledge gaps around how the interactions between the energy SDG targets and those of the non-energy-focused SDGs might play out in different contexts. In this Perspective, we report on a systematic assessment of the relevant energy literature, which we conducted to better our understanding of key energy-related interactions between SDGs. Our analysis indicates, first, that positive interactions between the SDGs outweigh the negative ones, both in number and magnitude. Second, of relevance for the scientific community, in order to fill knowledge gaps in critical areas, there is an urgent need for inter-disciplinary research geared toward developing new data, scientific tools, and fresh perspectives. Third, of relevance for policy-making, wider efforts to promote policy coherence and integrated assessments are required to address potential policy spillovers across sectors, sustainability domains, and geographic and temporal boundaries. ‘Doing energy right' is fundamental to the success of the SDGs, and energy scientists have a major role to play in offering guidance to the discourse.},

This paper attempts to offer a broader definition of big data that captures its other unique and defining characteristics. The rapid evolution and adoption of big data by industry has leapfrogged the discourse to popular outlets, forcing the academic press to catch up. Academic journals in numerous disciplines, which will benefit from a relevant discussion of big data, have yet to cover the topic. This paper presents a consolidated description of big data by integrating definitions from practitioners and academics. The paper's primary focus is on the analytic methods used for big data. A particular distinguishing feature of this paper is its focus on analytics related to unstructured data, which constitute 95{\%} of big data. This paper highlights the need to develop appropriate and efficient analytical methods to leverage massive volumes of heterogeneous data in unstructured text, audio, and video formats. This paper also reinforces the need to devise new tools for predictive analytics for structured big data. The statistical methods in practice were devised to infer from sample data. The heterogeneity, noise, and the massive size of structured big data calls for developing computationally efficient algorithms that may avoid big data pitfalls, such as spurious correlation.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine whether automated classification of document citations can be useful in reducing the time spent by experts reviewing journal articles for inclusion in updating systematic reviews of drug class efficacy for treatment of disease. Design: A test collection was built using the annotated reference files from 15 systematic drug class reviews. A voting perceptron-based automated citation classification system was constructed to classify each article as containing high-quality, drug class-specific evidence or not. Cross-validation experiments were performed to evaluate performance. Measurements: Precision, recall, and F-measure were evaluated at a range of sample weightings. Work saved over sampling at 95{\%} recall was used as the measure of value to the review process. Results: A reduction in the number of articles needing manual review was found for 11 of the 15 drug review topics studied. For three of the topics, the reduction was 50{\%} or greater. Conclusion: Automated document citation classification could be a useful tool in maintaining systematic reviews of the efficacy of drug therapy. Further work is needed to refine the classification system and determine the best manner to integrate the system into the production of systematic reviews.},

Whereas previous research on corporate communications has been small-scale or interested in selected lex- ical aspects and thematic categories identified ex ante, our approach allows for thematic patterns to emerge from the data. The analysis reveals a number of major trends and topic shifts pointing to changing practices of CSR. Nowadays `people', `communities', and `rights' seem to be given more prominence, whereas `environmental protection' appears to be less relevant. Using more es- tablished corpus-based methods, we subsequently explore two top phrases--- `human rights' and `climate change'---that were identified as representative of the shifting thematic patterns. Our approach strikes a balance between the purely quantitative and qualitative methodologies and offers applied linguists new ways of exploring discourse in large collections of texts.},

abstract = {Quantifying the similarity or dissimilarity between documents is an important task in authorship attribution, information retrieval, plagiarism detection, text mining, and many other areas of linguistic computing. Numerous similarity indices have been devised and used, but relatively little attention has been paid to calibrating such indices against externally imposed standards, mainly because of the difficulty of establishing agreed reference levels of inter-text similarity. The present article introduces a multi-register corpus gathered for this purpose, in which each text has been located in a similarity space based on ratings by human readers. This provides a resource for testing similarity measures derived from computational text-processing against reference levels derived from human judgement, i.e. external to the texts themselves. We describe the results of a benchmarking study in five different languages in which some widely used measures perform comparatively poorly. In particular, several alternative correlational measures (Pearson r, Spearman rho, tetrachoric correlation) consistently outperform cosine similarity on our data. A method of using what we call anchor texts' to extend this method from monolingual inter-text similarity-scoring to inter-text similarity-scoring across languages is also proposed and tested.},

abstract = {High quality, cost-effective medical care requires consideration of the best available, most appropriate evidence in the care of each patient, a practice known as Evidence-based Medicine (EBM). EBM is dependent upon the wide availability and coverage of accurate, objective syntheses called evidence reports (also called systematic reviews). These are compiled by a time and resourceintensive process that is largely manual, and that has not taken advantage of many of the advances in information processing technologies that have assisted other textual domains. We propose a specific text-mining based pipeline to support the creation and updating of evidence reports that provides support for the literature collection, collation, and triage steps of the systematic review process. The pipeline includes a metasearch engine that covers both bibliographic databases and selected “grey” literature; a module that classifies articles according to study type; a module for grouping studies that are closely related (e.g. that derive from the same underlying clinical trial or same study cohort); and an automated system that ranks publications according to the likelihood that they will meet inclusion criteria for the report. The proposed pipeline will also enable groups performing systematic review to reuse tools and models created by other groups, and will provide a test-bed for further informatics research to develop improved tools in the future. Ultimately, this should increase the rate that high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses can be generated, accessed and utilized by clinicians, patients, caregivers, and policymakers, resulting in better and more costeffective care.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the trends in energy consumption and CO2 emissions as a result of energy efficiency improvements in Swedish manufacturing industries between 1993 and 2008. Using data at the two-digit level, the performance of this sector is studied in terms of CO2 emissions, energy consumption, energy efficiency measured as energy intensity, value of production, fuel sources, energy prices and energy taxes. It was found that energy consumption, energy intensity and CO2 emission intensity, measured as production values, have decreased significantly in the Swedish manufacturing industries during the period studied. The results of the decomposition analysis show that output growth has not required higher energy consumption, leading to a reduction in both energy and CO2 emission intensities. The role of structural changes has been minor, and the trends of energy efficiency and CO2 emissions have been similar during the sample period. A stochastic frontier model was used to determine possible factors that may have influenced these trends. The results demonstrate that high energy prices, energy taxes, investments and electricity consumption have influenced the reduction of energy and CO2 emission intensities, indicating that Sweden has applied an adequate and effective energy policy. The study confirms that it is possible to achieve economic growth and sustainable development whilst also reducing the pressure on resources and energy consumption and promoting the shift towards a low-carbon economy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {A series of weaknesses in creativity, research design, and quality of writing continue to handicap energy social science. Many studies ask uninteresting research questions, make only marginal contributions, and lack innovative methods or application to theory. Many studies also have no explicit research design, lack rigor, or suffer from mangled structure and poor quality of writing. To help remedy these shortcomings, this Review offers suggestions for how to construct research questions; thoughtfully engage with concepts; state objectives; and appropriately select research methods. Then, the Review offers suggestions for enhancing theoretical, methodological, and empirical novelty. In terms of rigor, codes of practice are presented across seven method categories: experiments, literature reviews, data collection, data analysis, quantitative energy modeling, qualitative analysis, and case studies. We also recommend that researchers beware of hierarchies of evidence utilized in some disciplines, and that researchers place more emphasis on balance and appropriateness in research design. In terms of style, we offer tips regarding macro and microstructure and analysis, as well as coherent writing. Our hope is that this Review will inspire more interesting, robust, multi-method, comparative, interdisciplinary and impactful research that will accelerate the contribution that energy social science can make to both theory and practice.},

abstract = {This paper considers two related distortions in electricity markets: the lack of real-time retail pricing and the suppression of peak wholesale prices due to Installed Capacity requirements. I lay out a framework for understanding these problems using a two-stage entry model in which producers with multiple technologies set capacity and then sell electricity into wholesale markets as demand varies over time. The model is calibrated to supply and demand conditions in the PJM electricity market. I estimate that moving from 10 percent of consumers on real-time pricing to 20 percent would increase welfare in PJM by {\$}120 million per year. However, the welfare gains from clearer signals of scarcity prices under an Energy Only market design are more than twice as large. Furthermore, equilibrium peak prices in the Energy Only design drop to reasonable levels once a moderate share of retail consumers are on real-time pricing.},

abstract = {Many have observed the decline of scientific authority over the last three decades, for reasons ranging from the toxic legacies of Cold War science (Beck 1992), to the current commercialization and privatization of knowledge production (Mirowski 2011), to the success of social constructivist critique (Latour 2004). Whatever the cause(s), it seems clear that the relationship among academia, the military, and state and economic elites is shifting once again. A new regime of knowledge production is emerging (Pestre 2003) in which academia carries significantly less clout than it has over the previous half-century, and broadly legitimate knowledge claims are increasingly developed outside of the academy. These changes carry obvious implications for the future of academic legitimacy and institutions. The implications for environmental and social justice are less obvious, although perhaps even more important, as the ways in which knowledge is vetted and the questions investigated (or ignored) shift. In this article, I use exploration of the changing relationship between academic and extramural knowledge producers to lay out potential futures for the production of environmental knowledge. I argue that although academics have been notably unsuccessful in challenging private-sector, commercialized environmental knowledge claims, we are increasingly successful in leveraging our remaining authority to enable the democratization of knowledge production to intellectually and politically progressive ends.},

abstract = {Dynamic topic models (DTMs) are very effective in discover-ing topics and capturing their evolution trends in time series data. To do posterior inference of DTMs, existing methods are all batch algorithms that scan the full dataset before each update of the model and make inexact variational ap-proximations with mean-field assumptions. Due to a lack of a more scalable inference algorithm, despite the usefulness, DTMs have not captured large topic dynamics. This paper fills this research void, and presents a fast and parallelizable inference algorithm using Gibbs Sampling with Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics that does not make any unwarranted assumptions. We also present a Metropolis-Hastings based O(1) sampler for topic assign-ments for each word token. In a distributed environment, our algorithm requires very little communication between workers during sampling (almost embarrassingly parallel) and scales up to large-scale applications. We are able to learn the largest Dynamic Topic Model to our knowledge, and learned the dynamics of 1,000 topics from 2.6 million documents in less than half an hour, and our empirical re-sults show that our algorithm is not only orders of magnitude faster than the baselines but also achieves lower perplexity.},

The COP 21 agreement, defining new emission targets (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions - INDCs), will directly affect countries' environmental performance, but also social and economic dimensions if we consider the possible use of climate policy revenues to reduce poverty prevalence (SDG 1) and malnutrition (SDG 2) or to extend access to electricity (SDG 7) or to lower the pressure on public debt (SDG 8). This paper aims at giving an ex-ante assessment of the co-benefits and side effects of this new policy setting and, in particular, to shed some light on the influence of COP21 agreement on achieving SDGs. Our analysis relies on a recursive-dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model developed and enriched with indicators representative of each SDGs. CGE models have a flexible structure, and can capture trade‐offs and higher-order implications across sectors and countries that follows a shock or a policy. These models are well suited to assess the performance of economic indicators such as sectoral value added, GDP per capita, and public debt evolution; moreover, the CGE modelling literature of the past decades has highlighted that this is also a powerful tool to assess the evolution of some key environmental indicators, such as land use determined by land owners' revenues maximisation or GHG and CO2 emissions directly linked to agents' production and consumption choices (B{\"{o}}hringer and L{\"{o}}schel, 2006). Modelling social indicators in a CGE framework is a difficult task, especially when these imply dispersion measures such are poverty prevalence and inequality at the core of GOAL 1 and 10. In this case, we overcome the representative agent structure proper of CGE models empirically relying on the empirical literature and directly estimating the relations between indicators and endogenous variables of the model (Bourguignon et al., 2005; Ferreira et al., 2007; Montalvo and Ravallion, 2010). Extending the model with social and environmental indicators, in addition to the economic ones, allows assessing in an internally consistent framework how and at which extent changes in one sustainability sphere may affect the achievement of SDGs all around the world. Our framework considers 33 indicators covering 16 SDGs and classified into the three sustainability pillars. The analysis has world coverage, but for modelling reasons we aggregate the result in 40 countries/macro-regions. The historical records of indicators' values rely on international databases (Commission on Sustainable Development of the United Nations, EU Sustainable Development Strategy, and World Development Indicators from World Bank) and are the starting point in our baseline scenario design. The baseline reproduces a Shared Socio-economic Pathways 2 (SSP2), consistent with a RCP4.5, and it is used as a benchmark to assess the effects of two mitigation scenarios anticipating the outcome of COP 21. The two proposed mitigation scenarios consider a coordinated effort to curb GHG emissions from 2020: 1.Post-Paris Global Trade (global ITS) scenario: the abatement pledges stated in the INDCs submitted ahead of the Paris Conference (COP 21) are effective for the committing countries. The global climate policy implementation envisions an international emission trading scheme (ITS). 2.Post Paris EU ETS scenario: in this scenario the European Union (EU28) implements an Emission Trading System (ETS) as already foreseen by the EU ETS domestic legislation, while all other countries achieve their targets unilaterally with a domestic carbon tax. Both scenarios are characterised by two different recycling schemes of the revenues collected from the carbon market or the carbon taxes: •revenues are redistributed internally in a lump sum; •revenues are used in part internally in EU28 and other developed countries and in part flow to a Development Fund benefiting LDCs: EU28 uses at least 50{\%} of the revenues recycled to support clean energy in EU, 5{\%} goes to the Development Fund and the rest is redistributed internally. The other committing countries allocate 1{\%} of the carbon tax revenues to the Development Fund. In the LDCs revenues are recycled to achieve other SDGs, e.g. poverty and malnutrition reduction, access to education and electricity. This analysis will mainly focus on characterising the future trend of some social indicators, e.g. poverty prevalence and inequality, in the SSP2 baseline scenario, in addition to the usual economic and environmental indicators. Then, this baseline scenario will be used as a term of comparison to assess the impact of climate policy and different recycling scheme on environmental, social and economic indicators. Considering the INDCs as binding targets, COP21 agreement will determine a slight reduction of extreme poverty prevalence in the LDCs, but this outcome is mainly due to a leakage effect. The effect of climate policy on income distribution will be neutral and recycling carbon revenues with the creation of a Development Fund and a lump sum transfer to LDCs will have a negligible effect on poverty and inequality.},

This paper reviews and synthesises empirical evidence to identify what types of behaviour change intervention are most successful at saving energy in an office-type workplace. We draw on the field of health-related behaviour change interventions and adopt the Behaviour Change Wheel (Michie et al., 2014) as a framework through which to assess the success of the interventions reviewed here (n = 22 studies). We find that interventions creating social and physical opportunities for employees to save energy are the most successful i.e. which constitute Enablement (including direct support and greater control to employees), Environmental Restructuring (particularly automated and retrofitted technologies) and Modelling (various forms of social influence). The communal nature of most workplaces demands scrutiny to understand the effect of social influences. We provide recommendations for future research, including the need to consider forms of intervention not yet researched; Coercion, Restriction, and Training. We conclude by calling for further, well evaluated, energy saving behavioural interventions in a variety of workplaces to identify those techniques which offer the greatest success in saving energy and thus reducing carbon emissions.},

Second, we trained a topic model on a large set of clinical documents, which was then used to identify related terms for query expansion. Third, we obtained related terms from a large predicate database derived from Medline abstracts for query expansion. The three expansion methods were tested on a set of clinical notes. All three methods successfully achieved higher average recalls and average F-measures when compared with the baseline method. The average precisions and precision at 10, however, decreased with all expansions. Amongst the three expansion methods, the topic model-based method performed the best in terms of recall and F-measure.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Evidence-based medicine depends on the timely synthesis of research findings. An important source of synthesized evidence resides in systematic reviews. However, a bottleneck in review production involves dual screening of citations with titles and abstracts to find eligible studies. For this research, we tested the effect of various kinds of textual information (features) on performance of a machine learning classifier. Based on our findings, we propose an automated system to reduce screeing burden, as well as offer quality assurance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We built a database of citations from 5 systematic reviews that varied with respect to domain, topic, and sponsor. Consensus judgments regarding eligibility were inferred from published reports. We extracted 5 feature sets from citations: alphabetic, alphanumeric(+), indexing, features mapped to concepts in systematic reviews, and topic models. To simulate a two-person team, we divided the data into random halves. We optimized the parameters of a Bayesian classifier, then trained and tested models on alternate data halves. Overall, we conducted 50 independent tests.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All tests of summary performance (mean F3) surpassed the corresponding baseline, P{\textless}0.0001. The ranks for mean F3, precision, and classification error were statistically different across feature sets averaged over reviews; P-values for Friedman's test were .045, .002, and .002, respectively. Differences in ranks for mean recall were not statistically significant. Alphanumeric(+) features were associated with best performance; mean reduction in screening burden for this feature type ranged from 88{\%} to 98{\%} for the second pass through citations and from 38{\%} to 48{\%} overall.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A computer-assisted, decision support system based on our methods could substantially reduce the burden of screening citations for systematic review teams and solo reviewers. Additionally, such a system could deliver quality assurance both by confirming concordant decisions and by naming studies associated with discordant decisions for further consideration.},

abstract = {EDRP was a major project in Great Britain to test consumers responses to different forms of information about their energy use. Four energy suppliers each conducted trials of the impacts of various interventions (individually or in combination) between 2007 and 2010. The interventions used were primarily directed at reducing domestic energy consumption, with a minority focused on shifting energy use from periods of peak demand. The project involved over 60,000 households, including 18,000 with smart meters. Measures were generally applied at household level but one supplier also tested action at community level. The final analysis collates and builds on suppliers findings and additional analysis of the data on energy consumption and consumer feedback, together with a review of the wider literature to identify the interventions that have proved most effective in reducing consumption, and key messages about how such interventions can best be delivered. The report provides a unique source of information particularly pertinent to the forthcoming national roll- out of smart meters. It sets out the quantitative savings that were achieved through a range of interventions enabled by smart meters, demonstrating the potential of smart metering as an enabling platform for measures to influence consumer behaviour.},

abstract = {The past five years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of media and scientific publications on the topic of climate engineering, or geoengineering, and some scientists are increasingly calling for more research on climate engineering as a possible supplement to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. In this context, understanding the current state of climate engineering research can help inform policy discussions and guide future research directions. Bibliometric analysis—the quantitative analysis of publications—is particularly applicable to fields with large bodies of literature that are difficult to summarize by traditional review methods. The multidisciplinary nature of the published literature on climate engineering makes it an ideal candidate for bibliometric analysis. Publications on climate engineering are found to be relatively recent (more than half of all articles during 1988–2011 were published since 2008), include a higher than average percentage of nonresearch articles (30{\%} compared with 8–15{\%} in related scientific disciplines), and be predominately produced by countries located in the Northern Hemisphere and speaking English. The majority of this literature focuses on land-based methods of carbon sequestration, ocean iron fertilization, and solar radiation management and is produced with little collaboration among research groups. This study provides a summary of existing publications on climate engineering, a perspective on the scientific underpinnings of the global dialogue on climate engineering, and  a baseline for quantitatively monitoring the development of climate engineering research in the future.

abstract = {Scientific assessments play a crucial role in advising and shaping political decisions particularly in the environmental domain. Therefore, this and the accompanying paper (Part 2) present two case studies of international environmental assessments with a perspective on internal learning processes. When carried out over a longer period of time, scientific assessments provide an opportunity for learning from past experience and from other assessment experiences which gives them the opportunity to become more powerful institutions in the process of solving environmental problems and in advising political decision-making. The paper will investigate how the assessments at hand organised their learning processes and which factors might have been influential in these processes. To answer these questions, a conceptual framework will be developed drawing particularly on literature on organisational learning. This concept will be applied to two case studies on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and (Part 2) on the scientific assessment under the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP). Both cases are iterative processes with significant changes of the assessment institutions over time, but they differ in their basic structures and in their effectiveness with regard to political outcomes which allows for their comparison in order to draw general conclusions. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {In central Europe, ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate make up a large fraction of fine particles which pose a threat to human health. Most studies on air pollution through particulate matter investigate the influence of emission reductions of sulphur- and nitrogen oxides on aerosol concentration. Here, we focus on the influence of ammonia (NH3) emissions. Emission scenarios have been created on the basis of the improved ammonia emission parameterization implemented in the SMOKE for Europe and CMAQ model systems described in part I of this study. This includes emissions based on future European legislation (the National Emission Ceilings) as well as a dynamic evaluation of the influence of different agricultural sectors (e.g. animal husbandry) on particle formation. The study compares the concentrations of NH3, NH4+, NO3-, sulphur compounds and the total concentration of particles in winter and summer for a political-, technical- and behavioural scenario. It was found that a reduction of ammonia emissions by 50{\%} lead to a 24{\%} reduction of the total PM2.5 concentrations in northwest Europe. The observed reduction was mainly driven by reduced formation of ammonium nitrate. Moreover, emission reductions during winter had a larger impact than during the rest of the year. This leads to the conclusion that a reduction of the ammonia emissions from the agricultural sector related to animal husbandry could be more efficient than the reduction from other sectors due to its larger share in winter ammonia emissions.},

In the case of patents and natural science publications, those that are cited at least once are cited slightly more when they draw on research outside of their area.

Reducing energy demand through optimal operation is the subject of building control research, while human satisfaction in buildings is studied in the thermal comfort community. Thus, balancing the two is necessary for a sustainable and comfortable building stock. We review both research fields and their relationship using a data-driven approach. Based on specific search terms, all relevant abstracts from the Web Of Science database are downloaded and analyzed using the text mining software VOSviewer. We visualize the scientific landscapes of historic and recent trends, and analyze the citation network to investigate the interaction between thermal comfort and building control research. We find that building control focuses predominantly on energy savings rather than incorporating results from thermal comfort, especially when it comes to occupant satisfaction. We identify potential research directions in terms of bridging the two fields.},

National commitments will be more achievable if interventions take into account key psychological, social, cultural and organizational factors that influence energy choices, along with factors of an infrastructural, technical and economic nature. Broader engagement of social and behavioural science is needed to identify promising opportunities for reducing fossil fuel consumption. Here we discuss opportunities for change in households and organizations, primarily at short and intermediate timescales, and identify opportunities that have been underused in much of energy policy. Based on this survey, we suggest design principles for interventions by governments and other organizations, and identify areas of emphasis for future social science and interdisciplinary research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Identifying relevant studies for inclusion in a systematic review (i.e. screening) is a complex, laborious and expensive task. Recently, a number of studies has shown that the use of machine learning and text mining methods to automatically identify relevant studies has the potential to drastically decrease the workload involved in the screening phase. The vast majority of these machine learning methods exploit the same underlying principle, i.e. a study is modelled as a bag-of-words (BOW). METHODS We explore the use of topic modelling methods to derive a more informative representation of studies. We apply Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), an unsupervised topic modelling approach, to automatically identify topics in a collection of studies. We then represent each study as a distribution of LDA topics. Additionally, we enrich topics derived using LDA with multi-word terms identified by using an automatic term recognition (ATR) tool. For evaluation purposes, we carry out automatic identification of relevant studies using support vector machine (SVM)-based classifiers that employ both our novel topic-based representation and the BOW representation. RESULTS Our results show that the SVM classifier is able to identify a greater number of relevant studies when using the LDA representation than the BOW representation. These observations hold for two systematic reviews of the clinical domain and three reviews of the social science domain. CONCLUSIONS A topic-based feature representation of documents outperforms the BOW representation when applied to the task of automatic citation screening. The proposed term-enriched topics are more informative and less ambiguous to systematic reviewers.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Conducting a systematic review in social policy is a resource-intensive process in terms of time and funds. It is thus important to understand the scope of the evidence base of a topic area prior to conducting a synthesis of primary research in order to maximize these resources. One approach to conserving resources is to map out the available evidence prior to undertaking a traditional synthesis. A few examples of this approach exist in the form of gap maps, overviews of reviews, and systematic maps supported by social policy and systematic review agencies alike. Despite this growing call for alternative approaches to systematic reviews, it is still common for systematic review teams to embark on a traditional in-depth review only. OBJECTIVES This article describes a three-stage approach to systematic reviewing that was applied to a systematic review focusing in interventions for smallholder farmers in Africa. We argue that this approach proved useful in helping us to understand the evidence base. RESULTS By applying preliminary steps as part of a three-stage approach, we were able to maximize the resources needed to conduct a traditional systematic review on a more focused research question. This enabled us to identify and fill real knowledge gaps, build on work that had already been done, and avoid wasting resources on areas of work that would have no useful outcome. It also facilitated meaningful engagement between the review team and our key policy stakeholders.},

abstract = {Text classification is a foundational task in many NLP applications. Traditional text classifiers often rely on many human-designed features, such as dictionaries, knowledge bases and special tree kernels. In contrast to traditional methods, we introduce a recurrent con-volutional neural network for text classification with-out human-designed features. In our model, we apply a recurrent structure to capture contextual information as far as possible when learning word representations, which may introduce considerably less noise compared to traditional window-based neural networks. We also employ a max-pooling layer that automatically judges which words play key roles in text classification to cap-ture the key components in texts. We conduct experi-ments on four commonly used datasets. The experimen-tal results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several datasets, partic-ularly on document-level datasets.},

abstract = {The concepts of sustainable development have experienced extraordinary success since their advent in the 1980s. They are now an integral part of the agenda of governments and corporations, and their goals have become central to the mission of research laboratories and universities worldwide. However, it remains unclear how far the field has progressed as a scientific discipline, especially given its ambitious agenda of integrating theory, applied science, and policy, making it relevant for development globally and generating a new interdisciplinary synthesis across fields. To address these questions, we assembled a corpus of scholarly publications in the field and analyzed its temporal evolution, geographic distribution, disciplinary composition, and collaboration structure. We show that sustainability science has been growing explosively since the late 1980s when foundational publications in the field increased its pull on new authors and intensified their interactions. The field has an unusual geographic footprint combining contributions and connecting through collaboration cities and nations at very different levels of development. Its decomposition into traditional disciplines reveals its emphasis on the management of human, social, and ecological systems seen primarily from an engineering and policy perspective. Finally, we show that the integration of these perspectives has created a new field only in recent years as judged by the emergence of a giant component of scientific collaboration. These developments demonstrate the existence of a growing scientific field of sustainability science as an unusual, inclusive and ubiquitous scientific practice and bode well for its continued impact and longevity.},

abstract = {In-home displays, dynamic pricing, and automated devices aim to reduce residential electricity use-overall and during peak hours. We present a meta-analysis of 32 studies of the impacts of these interventions, conducted in the US or Canada. We find that methodological problems are common in the design of these studies, leading to artificially inflated results relative to what one would expect if the interventions were implemented in the general population. Particular problems include having volunteer participants who may have been especially motivated to reduce their electricity use, letting participants choose their preferred intervention, and having high attrition rates. Using estimates of bias from medical clinical trials as a guide, we recalculate impact estimates to adjust for bias, resulting in values that are often less than half of those reported in the reviewed studies. We estimate that in-home displays were the most effective intervention for reducing overall electricity use ({\~{}}. 4{\%} using reported data; {\~{}}. 3{\%} after adjusting for bias), while dynamic pricing significantly reduced peak demand ({\~{}}. 11{\%} reported; {\~{}}. 6{\%} adjusted), especially when used in conjunction with home automation ({\~{}}. 25{\%} reported; {\~{}}. 14{\%} adjusted). We conclude with recommendations that can improve pilot studies and the soundness of decisions based on their results. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods—they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation.},

abstract = {Power development planning within a country is traditionally the responsibility of the public sector. In Kenya, as with most other African governments, the task of planning for, and delivering power to the consumers, from households to industry to the service sectors, rests with governments and their formal agencies. While government has been going out of its way to invest in, and harness new and additional sources of electricity supply, sugar factories have been wasting away huge energy resources in form of bagasse fuel and other waste products of the sugar processing industry. Studies have shown that overall unit costs for producing electrical energy is lower for bagasse cogeneration plants than for fossil fuel powered plants. However regulatory barriers and inadequate financial incentives have been responsible for lack of investment in commercial bagasse cogeneration plants. Uncompetitive purchase prices and high investment costs have combined to discourage the growth of this sector. Due to historical regulatory restrictions, sugar power producers have one major reliable outlet for their power, the key to the growth of sugar-power production lies in compelling KPLC to purchase power form cane factories at economically efficient prices. Regulatory action is necessary for investment to flow into cane-power production. Policy makers in government must be convinced to cognise the priority of bagasse power development. In the course of this the process must be carefully managed. Cogeneration projects must be integrated into the least cost Power Development Plan. Their outputs must be scaled and timed to fit the country's overall growth in demand for power, and to do so by being cost effective suppliers compared to available alternative sources. In talking about regulatory intervention we must not overlook the environmental perspective. Up to now, not enough emphasis has been placed on the beneficial impacts to the environment that would follow from meeting future power demands from cane rather than fossil fuels. In all our factories today, bagasse is treated as waste and existing boilers are designed to burn it inefficiently as a method of disposal. Excess bagasse is piled into rotting mountains emitting methane and other environmentally unfriendly gases. We have the opportunity now to convert such inefficient processes to generate power for the grid without adding to the total emission from the sugar plant. When such additional power is used to replace fossil-fired generation, greater environmental benefits will be realised. There is however, no obvious form within which private sugar companies can plan and coordinate their investment decisions in bagasse cogeneration with those responsible within the power sector for overall power production expansion. There is also a discernable lack of trust within the utilities in the reliability of cane power production. On the other hand, supply of firm power to the grid is a new activity for the sugar companies which will require some operation and management adjustment in the sector.},

Despite the increased importance of social media in the (re)production of discursive power in society, this is the first study of its kind. The analysis shows that Muslims are portrayed in the forum as a homogeneous outgroup that is embroiled in conflict, violence and extremism: characteristics that are described as emanating from Islam as a religion. These patterns are strikingly similar to – but often more extreme versions of – those previously found in analysis of traditional media. This indicates that, in this case, the internet forum seems to serve as an “online amplifier” that reflects and reinforces existing discourses in traditional media, which is likely to result in even stronger polarizing effects on public discourses.},

Previous studies have shown that human effort can be reduced by using machine learning software to prioritise large reference collections such that most of the relevant references are identified before screening is completed. We describe and evaluate RobotAnalyst, a Web‐based software system that combines text‐mining and machine learning algorithms for organising references by their content and actively prioritising them based on a relevancy classification model trained and updated throughout the process. We report an evaluation over 22 reference collections (most are related to public health topics) screened using RobotAnalyst with a total of 43 610 abstract‐level decisions. The number of references that needed to be screened to identify 95{\%} of the abstract‐level inclusions for the evidence review was reduced on 19 of the 22 collections. Significant gains over random sampling were achieved for all reviews conducted with active prioritisation, as compared with only two of five when prioritisation was not used. RobotAnalyst's descriptive clustering and topic modelling functionalities were also evaluated by public health analysts. Descriptive clustering provided more coherent organisation than topic modelling, and the content of the clusters was apparent to the users across a varying number of clusters. This is the first large‐scale study using technology‐assisted screening to perform new reviews, and the positive results provide empirical evidence that RobotAnalyst can accelerate the identification of relevant studies. The results also highlight the issue of user complacency and the need for a stopping criterion to realise the work savings.},

abstract = {Sustainability is an important concept for society, economics, and the environment, with thousands of research papers published on the subject annually. As sustainability science becomes a distinctive research field, it is important to define sustainability clearly and grasp the entire structure, current status, and future directions of sustainability science. This paper provides an academic landscape of sustainability science by analyzing the citation network of papers published in academic journals. A topological clustering method is used to detect the subdomains of sustainability science. Results show the existence of 15 main research clusters: Agriculture, Fisheries, Ecological Economics, Forestry (agroforestry), Forestry (tropical rain forest), Business, Tourism, Water, Forestry (biodiversity), Urban Planning, Rural Sociology, Energy, Health, Soil, and Wildlife. Agriculture, Fisheries, Ecological Economics, and Forestry (agroforestry) clusters are predominant among these. The Energy cluster is currently developing, as indicated by the age of papers in the cluster, although it has a relatively small number of papers. These results are compared with those obtained by natural language processing. Education, Biotechnology, Medical, Livestock, Climate Change, Welfare, and Livelihood clusters are uniquely extracted by natural language processing, because they are common topics across clusters in the citation network.},

abstract = {Livestock production systems currently occupy around28{\%}of the land surface of the European Union (equivalent to65{\%}of the agricultural land). Inconjunction with otherhumanactivities, livestock production systems affect water, air and soil quality, global climate and biodiversity, altering the biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon. Here,we quantify the contribution of European livestock production to these major impacts. For each environmental effect, the contribution of livestock is expressed as shares of the emitted compounds and land used, as compared to the whole agricultural sector. The results show that the livestock sector contributes significantly to agricultural environmental impacts. This contribution is78{\%}for terrestrial biodiversity loss,80{\%}for soil acidification and air pollution (ammoniaand nitrogen oxides emissions),81{\%}for global warming, and73{\%}for water pollution (bothNandP). The agriculture sector itself is one of the major contributors to these environmental impacts, ranging between12{\%}for global warming and59{\%}for Nwater quality impact. Significant progress in mitigating these environmental impacts in Europe will only be possible through a combination of technological measures reducing livestock emissions, improved food choices and reduced food waste of European citizens.

abstract = {The UK government has set ambitious targets to reduce carbon emissions, and lowering energy demand within workplaces is important to help meet these. With the rollout of smart metres and the availability of more fine-grained energy monitoring equipment for the workplace, it is increasingly possible to disaggregate collective energy consumption and apportion this among building users. This article presents an interdisciplinary perspective on the rationale and feasibility of different approaches to apportionment to motivate staff to reduce energy consumption. Our review indicates greatest potential for energy saving when consumption is apportioned to small to medium-sized groups, rather than individuals or entire buildings, particularly when they represent existing communities to which staff members strongly identify. We highlight the complexity of technical, psychological, social and organisational factors that not only inspire, but also often confound, efforts to innovate in this area.},

abstract = {In systematic reviews, the growing number of published studies imposes a significant screening workload on reviewers. Active learning is a promising approach to reduce the workload by automating some of the screening decisions, but it has been evaluated for a limited number of disciplines. The suitability of applying active learning to complex topics in disciplines such as social science has not been studied, and the selection of useful criteria and enhancements to address the data imbalance problem in systematic reviews remains an open problem. We applied active learning with two criteria (certainty and uncertainty) and several enhancements in both clinical medicine and social science (specifically, public health) areas, and compared the results in both. The results show that the certainty criterion is useful for finding relevant documents, and weighting positive instances is promising to overcome the data imbalance problem in both data sets. Latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) is also shown to be promising when little manually-assigned information is available. Active learning is effective in complex topics, although its efficiency is limited due to the difficulties in text classification. The most promising criterion and weighting method are the same regardless of the review topic, and unsupervised techniques like LDA have a possibility to boost the performance of active learning without manual annotation.},

abstract = {In scoping reviews, boundaries of relevant evidence may be initially fuzzy, with refined conceptual understanding of interventions and their proposed mechanisms of action an intended output of the scoping process rather than its starting point. Electronic searches are therefore sensitive, often retrieving very large record sets that are impractical to screen in their entirety. This paper describes methods for applying and evaluating the use of text mining (TM) technologies to reduce impractical screening workload in reviews, using examples of two extremely large-scale scoping reviews of public health evidence (choice architecture (CA) and economic environment (EE)). Electronic searches retrieved {\textgreater}800,000 (CA) and {\textgreater}1 million (EE) records. TM technologies were used to prioritise records for manual screening. TM performance was measured prospectively. TM reduced manual screening workload by 90{\%} (CA) and 88{\%} (EE) compared with conventional screening (absolute reductions of ≈430 000 (CA) and ≈378 000 (EE) records). This study expands an emerging corpus of empirical evidence for the use of TM to expedite study selection in reviews. By reducing screening workload to manageable levels, TM made it possible to assemble and configure large, complex evidence bases that crossed research discipline boundaries. These methods are transferable to other scoping and systematic reviews incorporating conceptual development or explanatory dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

While a lot of papers have been presented on applying AL to natural language processing tasks reporting impressive savings, little work has been done on defining a stopping criterion. In this work, we present a stopping criterion for active learning based on the way instances are selected during uncertainty-based sampling and verify its applicability in a variety of settings. The statistical learning models used in our study are support vector machines (SVMs), maximum entropy models and Bayesian logistic regression and the tasks performed are text classification, named entity recognition and shallow parsing. In addition, we present a method for multiclass mutually exclusive SVM active learning. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive discussion of the market value of variable renewable energy (VRE). The inherent variability of wind speeds and solar radiation affects the price that VRE generators receive on the market (market value). During windy and sunny times the additional electricity supply reduces the prices. Because the drop is larger with more installed capacity, the market value of VRE falls with higher penetration rate. This study aims to develop a better understanding on how the market value with penetration, and how policies and prices affect the market value. Quantitative evidence is derived from a review of published studies, regression analysis of market data, and the calibrated model of the European electricity market EMMA. We find the value of wind power to fall from 110{\%} of the average power price to 50-80{\%} as wind penetration increases from zero to 30{\%} of total electricity consumption. For solar power, similarly low value levels are reached already at 15{\%} penetration. Hence, competitive large-scale renewable deployment will be more difficult to accomplish than as many anticipate. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {As massive repositories of real-time human commentary, social media platforms have arguably evolved far beyond passive facilitation of online social interactions. Rapid analysis of information content in online social media streams (news articles, blogs,tweets etc.) is the need of the hour as it allows business and government bodies to understand public opinion about products and policies. In most of these settings, data points appear as a stream of high dimensional feature vectors. Guided by real-world industrial deployment scenarios, we revisit the problem of online learning of topics from streaming social media content. On one hand, the topics need to be dynamically adapted to the statistics of incoming datapoints, and on the other hand, early detection of rising new trends is important in many applications. We propose an online nonnegative matrix factorization framework to capture the evolution and emergence of themes in unstructured text under a novel temporal regularization framework. We develop scalable optimization algorithms for our framework, propose a new set of evaluation metrics, and report promising empirical results on traditional TDT tasks as well as streaming Twitter data. Our system is able to rapidly capture emerging themes, track existing topics over time while maintaining temporal consistency and continuity in user views, and can be explicitly configured to bound the amount of information being presented to the user.},

abstract = {Published research on smart homes and their users is growing exponentially, yet a clear understanding of who these users are and how they might use smart home technologies is missing from a field being overwhelmingly pushed by technology developers. Through a systematic analysis of peer-reviewed literature on smart homes and their users, this paper takes stock of the dominant research themes and the linkages and disconnects between them. Key findings within each of nine themes are analysed, grouped into three: (1) views of the smart home-functional, instrumental, socio-technical; (2) users and the use of the smart home-prospective users, interactions and decisions, using technologies in the home; and (3) challenges for realising the smart home-hardware and software, design, domestication. These themes are integrated into an organising framework for future research that identifies the presence or absence of cross-cutting relationships between different understandings of smart homes and their users. The usefulness of the organising framework is illustrated in relation to two major concerns-privacy and control-that have been narrowly interpreted to date, precluding deeper insights and potential solutions. Future research on smart homes and their users can benefit by exploring and developing cross-cutting relationships between the research themes identified. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag London.},

@article{Dunn2017,
abstract = {For more than a decade, a popular theory amongst scholars of science-policy interactions has been that research is most effective at informing policy and decision-making processes when it is credible, relevant and legitimate (CRELE) with multiple audiences simultaneously. In this paper, we argue that this triad reflects a primarily intra-scientific perspective, rather than the needs and considerations of policy-makers themselves. Using over seventy semi-structured interviews with policy-makers, we present alternative criteria for effective science-policy interactions based on experiences in the urban water sector. We find that applicability, comprehensiveness, timing and accessibility (ACTA) better summarises the most important aspects of scientific research when it comes to influencing decision-making, while finding that CRELE was a poor predictor of policy-maker concerns. Whilst the ACTA quartet effectively gives double-billing to the ‘relevance' component of CRELE, credibility and legitimacy were much lower priorities for policy-makers interviewed. This article questions whether CRELE is a useful mindset for researchers interested in policy influence. These findings will be of interest to those engaged in debates related to effective science-policy interactions more broadly, and researchers that want to marshal policy influence more specifically.},

abstract = {There is a limited understanding of the effects of soil properties on biochar carbon (C) stability. This knowledge is essential to evaluate the capacity of biochar for long-term soil C sequestration fully. In this study two biochars, produced by slow pyrolysis at 450 or 550◦C from a $\delta$13C-depleted (−36.4‰) Eucalyptus saligna Sm. woody material, were incubated in four soils (Inceptisol, Entisol, Oxisol and Vertisol) of contrasting chemical and mineralogical properties. The total biochar-C mineralized over 12 months was 0.30–1.14 and 0.97–2.71{\%} from the soil-biochar mixtures incubated at 20 and 40◦C, respectively. The total biochar-C mineralized (mg CO2-C per unit of native soil organic C (SOC) basis) from soils incubated with the 450◦C biochar was approximately twice the corresponding amount mineralized from the 550◦C biochar systems. The influence of soil properties on biochar-C mineralization was greater for the 450◦C biochar than the 550◦C biochar. The smallest proportion of C mineralized from the 450◦C biochar occurred in the Inceptisol incubated at 20◦C and in the Oxisol at 40◦C. However, when expressed on a per unit of native SOC basis, the C mineralization of the 450 and 550◦C biochars was least in the Oxisol and greatest in the Inceptisol at both incubation temperatures. Mean residence times (MRTs) of the biochars estimated using the two-pool exponential model varied between 44 and 610 years. The estimated MRT of the biochars may vary under field conditions depending upon the environmental conditions and addition of labile C from plants. Our results indicate that biochar-C was stabilized by variable charge minerals in the Oxisol and that the stabilization occurred rapidly at high temperatures.},

However, these farms would significantly change land surface properties, and, if sufficiently large, the farms may lead to unintended climate consequences. In this study, we used a climate model with dynamic vegetation to show that large-scale installations of wind and solar farms covering the Sahara lead to a local temperature increase and more than a twofold precipitation increase, especially in the Sahel, through increased surface friction and reduced albedo. The resulting increase in vegetation further enhances precipitation, creating a positive albedo-precipitation-vegetation feedback that contributes {\~{}}80{\%} of the precipitation increase for wind farms.

abstract = {In recent years, topic modeling has become an established method in the analysis of text corpora, with probabilistic techniques such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) commonly employed for this purpose. However, it might be argued that adequate attention is often not paid to the issue of topic coherence, the semantic interpretability of the top terms usually used to describe discovered topics. Nevertheless, a number of studies have proposed measures for analyzing such coherence, where these have been largely focused on topics found by LDA, with matrix decomposition techniques such as Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) being somewhat overlooked in comparison. This motivates the current work, where we compare and analyze topics found by popular variants of both NMF and LDA in multiple corpora in terms of both their coherence and associated generality, using a combination of existing and new measures, including one based on distributional semantics. Two out of three coherence measures find NMF to regularly produce more coherent topics, with higher levels of generality and redundancy observed with the LDA topic descriptors. In all cases, we observe that the associated term weighting strategy plays a major role. The results observed with NMF suggest that this may be a more suitable topic modeling method when analyzing certain corpora, such as those associated with niche or non-mainstream domains.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The changing global climate is producing increasingly unusual weather relative to preindustrial conditions. In an absolute sense, these changing conditions constitute direct evidence of anthropogenic climate change. However, human evaluation of weather as either normal or abnormal will also be influenced by a range of factors including expectations, memory limitations, and cognitive biases. Here we show that experience of weather in recent years—rather than longer historical periods—determines the climatic baseline against which current weather is evaluated, potentially obscuring public recognition of anthropogenic climate change. We employ variation in decadal trends in temperature at weekly and county resolution over the continental United States, combined with discussion of the weather drawn from over 2 billion social media posts. These data indicate that the remarkability of particular temperatures changes rapidly with repeated exposure. Using sentiment analysis tools, we provide evidence for a “boiling frog” effect: The declining noteworthiness of historically extreme temperatures is not accompanied by a decline in the negative sentiment that they induce, indicating that social normalization of extreme conditions rather than adaptation is driving these results. Using climate model projections we show that, despite large increases in absolute temperature, anomalies relative to our empirically estimated shifting baseline are small and not clearly distinguishable from zero throughout the 21st century.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our framework enables researchers to discover high-dimensional textual interventions and estimate the ways that observed treatments affect text-based outcomes. We argue that nearly all text-based causal inferences depend upon a latent representation of the text and we provide a framework to learn the latent representation. But estimating this latent representation, we show, creates new risks: we may introduce an identification problem or overfit. To address these risks we describe a split-sample framework and apply it to estimate causal effects from an experiment on immigration attitudes and a study on bureaucratic response. Our work provides a rigorous foundation for text-based causal inferences.},

We cover major historical milestones in the development of this specialism from the 1960s to today and discuss its relationship with the sociology of scientific knowledge, the library and information sciences, and science policy issues such as indicator development. The disciplinary organization of scientometrics is analyzed both conceptually and empirically. A state-of-the-art review of five major research threads is provided.},

abstract = {Calls for more broad-based, integrated, useful knowledge now abound in the world of global environmental change science. They evidence many scientists' desire to help humanity confront the momentous biophysical implications of its own actions. But they also reveal a limited conception of social science and virtually ignore the humanities. They thereby endorse a stunted conception of 'human dimensions' at a time when the challenges posed by global environmental change are increasing in magnitude, scale and scope. Here, we make the case for a richer conception predicated on broader intellectual engagement and identify some preconditions for its practical fulfilment. Interdisciplinary dialogue, we suggest, should engender plural representations of Earth's present and future that are reflective of divergent human values and aspirations. In turn, this might insure publics and decision-makers against overly narrow conceptions of what is possible and desirable as they consider the profound questions raised by global environmental change.},

abstract = {As massive repositories of real-time human commentary, social media platforms have arguably evolved far beyond passive facilitation of online social interactions. Rapid analysis of information content in online social media streams (news articles, blogs,tweets etc.) is the need of the hour as it allows business and government bodies to understand public opinion about products and policies. In most of these settings, data points appear as a stream of high dimensional feature vectors. Guided by real-world industrial deployment scenarios, we revisit the problem of online learning of topics from streaming social media content. On one hand, the topics need to be dynamically adapted to the statistics of incoming datapoints, and on the other hand, early detection of rising new trends is important in many applications. We propose an online nonnegative matrix factorization framework to capture the evolution and emergence of themes in unstructured text under a novel temporal regularization framework. We develop scalable optimization algorithms for our framework, propose a new set of evaluation metrics, and report promising empirical results on traditional TDT tasks as well as streaming Twitter data. Our system is able to rapidly capture emerging themes, track existing topics over time while maintaining temporal consistency and continuity in user views, and can be explicitly configured to bound the amount of information being presented to the user.},

abstract = {Binary classifiers are routinely evaluated with performance measures such as sensitivity and specificity, and performance is frequently illustrated with Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) plots. Alternative measures such as positive predictive value (PPV) and the associated Precision/Recall (PRC) plots are used less frequently. Many bioinformatics studies develop and evaluate classifiers that are to be applied to strongly imbalanced datasets in which the number of negatives outweighs the number of positives significantly. While ROC plots are visually appealing and provide an overview of a classifier's performance across a wide range of specificities, one can ask whether ROC plots could be misleading when applied in imbalanced classification scenarios. We show here that the visual interpretability of ROC plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. PRC plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions. Our findings have potential implications for the interpretation of a large number of studies that use ROC plots on imbalanced datasets.},

It focuses on three components of regional climate assessments: interdisciplinarity, interaction with stakeholders and production of usable knowledge, and on the role of three explanatory variables - the level of 'fit' between state of knowledge production and application, disciplinary and personal flexibility, and availability of resources - which affect the co-production of science and policy in the context of integrated assessments. It finds that although no single model can fulfill the multitude of goals of such assessments, it is in highly interactive models that the possibilities of higher levels of innovation and related social impact are most likely to occur. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Disruptive extreme weather events, including hurricanes, focus public attention in new and different ways, offering a unique window of opportunity to analyze how a focusing event influences public discourse. Media coverage of extreme weather events simultaneously shapes and reflects public discourse on climate issues. Here we analyze climate and energy newspaper coverage of Hurricanes Katrina (2005) and Sandy (2012) using topic models, mathematical techniques used to discover abstract topics within a set of documents. Our results demonstrate that post-Katrina media coverage does not contain a climate change topic, and the energy topic is limited to discussion of energy prices, markets, and the economy with almost no explicit linkages made between energy and climate change. In contrast, post-Sandy media coverage does contain a prominent climate change topic, a distinct energy topic, as well as integrated representation of climate change and energy, indicating a shift in climate and energy reporting between Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper investigates households' preferences to reduce their carbon footprint (CF) measured in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). It assumes that a substantial CF reduction of households is essential to reach the 1.5 °C goal under the Paris Agreement. Data was collected in four mid-size cities in France, Germany, Norway, and Sweden. Quantitative data was obtained from 308 households using a CF calculator based on a questionnaire, and a simulation game. The latter investigated households' preferences when being confronted with the objective to reduce their CF by 50 percent by 2030 in a voluntary and forced scenario. Our results show that the greater the CO2e-reduction potential of a mitigation action, the less willing a household was to implement that action. Households preferred actions with moderate lifestyle changes foremost in the food sector. Voluntarily, households reached a 25{\%} footprint reduction by 2030. To reach a substantial reduction of 50 percent, households needed to choose actions that meant considerable lifestyle changes, mainly related to mobility. Given our results, the 1.5 °C goal is unlikely to be realizable currently, unless households receive major policy support. Lastly, the strikingly similar preferences of households in the four European cities investigated seem to justify strong EU and international policies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This study analyzes the political agenda of the European Parliament (EP) plenary, how it has evolved over time, and the manner in which Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have reacted to external and internal stimuli when making plenary speeches. To unveil the plenary agenda and detect latent themes in legislative speeches over time, MEP speech content is analyzed using a new dynamic topic modeling method based on two layers of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). This method is applied to a new corpus of all English language legislative speeches in the EP plenary from the period 1999-2014. Our findings suggest that two-layer NMF is a valuable alternative to existing dynamic topic modeling approaches found in the literature, and can unveil niche topics and associated vocabularies not captured by existing methods. Substantively, our findings suggest that the political agenda of the EP evolves significantly over time and reacts to exogenous events such as EU Treaty referenda and the emergence of the Euro-crisis. MEP contributions to the plenary agenda are also found to be impacted upon by voting behaviour and the committee structure of the Parliament.},

abstract = {The boundary between science and policy is only one of several boundaries that hinder the linking of scientific and technical information to decision making. Managing boundaries between disciplines, across scales of geography and jurisdiction, and between different forms of knowledge is also often critical to transferring information. The research presented in this paper finds that information requires three (not mutually exclusive) attributes – salience, credibility, and legitimacy – and that what makes boundary crossing difficult is that actors on different sides of a boundary perceive and value salience, credibility, and legitimacy differently. Presenting research on water management regimes in the United States, international agricultural research systems, El Ni{\~{n}}o forecasting systems in the Pacific and southern Africa, and fisheries in the North Atlantic, this paper explores: 1) how effective boundary work involves creating salient, credible, and legitimate information simultaneously for multiple audiences; 2) the thresholds, complementarities and tradeoffs between salience, credibility, and legitimacy when crossing boundaries; and 3) propositions for institutional mechanisms in boundary organizations which effectively balance tradeoffs, take advantage on complementarities, and reach thresholds of salience, credibility, and legitimacy.},

abstract = {Dynamic topic models (DTMs) model the evolution of prevalent themes in literature, online media, and other forms of text over time. DTMs assume that word co-occurrence statistics change continuously and therefore impose continuous stochastic process priors on their model parameters. These dynamical priors make inference much harder than in regular topic models, and also limit scalability. In this paper, we present several new results around DTMs. First, we extend the class of tractable priors from Wiener processes to the generic class of Gaussian processes (GPs). This allows us to explore topics that develop smoothly over time, that have a long-term memory or are temporally concentrated (for event detection). Second, we show how to perform scalable approximate inference in these models based on ideas around stochastic variational inference and sparse Gaussian processes. This way we can train a rich family of DTMs to massive data. Our experiments on several large-scale datasets show that our generalized model allows us to find interesting patterns that were not accessible by previous approaches.},

All rights reserved.The growing urgency, complexity and "wickedness" of sustainability problems-from climate change and biodiversity loss to ecosystem degradation and persistent poverty and inequality-present fundamental challenges to scientific knowledge production and its use. While there is little doubt that science has a crucial role to play in our ability to pursue sustainability goals, critical questions remain as to how to most effectively organize research and connect it to actions that advance social and natural wellbeing. Drawing on interviews with leading sustainability scientists, this book examines how researchers in the emerging, interdisciplinary field of sustainability science are attempting to define sustainability, establish research agendas, and link the knowledge they produce to societal action. Pairing these insights with case studies of innovative sustainability research centres, the book reformulates the sustainability science research agenda and its relationship to decision-making and social action. It repositions the field as a "science of design" that aims to enrich public reasoning and deliberation while also working to generate social and technological innovations for a more sustainable future. This timely book gives students, researchers and practitioners a valuable and unique analysis of the emergence of sustainability science, and both the opportunities and barriers faced by scientific efforts to contribute to social action.},

Evidence-gap maps are thematic evidence collections covering a range of issues such as maternal health, HIV/AIDS, and agriculture. They present a visual overview of existing systematic reviews or impact evaluations in a sector or subsector, schematically representing the types of interventions evaluated and outcomes reported. Gap maps enable policy makers and practitioners to explore the findings and quality of the existing evidence and facilitate informed judgment and evidence-based decision making in international development policy and practice. The gap map also identifies key"gaps"where little or no evidence from impact evaluations and systematic reviews is available and where future research should be focused. Thus, gap maps can be a useful tool for developing a strategic approach to building the evidence base in a particular sector. This paper provides an introduction to evidence-gap maps, outlines the gap-map methodology, and presents some examples.},

abstract = {The concepts of sustainable development have experienced extraordinary success since their advent in the 1980s. They are now an integral part of the agenda of governments and corporations, and their goals have become central to the mission of research laboratories and universities worldwide. However, it remains unclear how far the field has progressed as a scientific discipline, especially given its ambitious agenda of integrating theory, applied science, and policy, making it relevant for development globally and generating a new interdisciplinary synthesis across fields. To address these questions, we assembled a corpus of scholarly publications in the field and analyzed its temporal evolution, geographic distribution, disciplinary composition, and collaboration structure. We show that sustainability science has been growing explosively since the late 1980s when foundational publications in the field increased its pull on new authors and intensified their interactions. The field has an unusual geographic footprint combining contributions and connecting through collaboration cities and nations at very different levels of development. Its decomposition into traditional disciplines reveals its emphasis on the management of human, social, and ecological systems seen primarily from an engineering and policy perspective. Finally, we show that the integration of these perspectives has created a new field only in recent years as judged by the emergence of a giant component of scientific collaboration. These developments demonstrate the existence of a growing scientific field of sustainability science as an unusual, inclusive and ubiquitous scientific practice and bode well for its continued impact and longevity.},

abstract = {and On behalf of the founding members of the ICASR group Abstract Systematic reviews (SR) are vital to health care, but have become complicated and time-consuming, due to the rapid expansion of evidence to be synthesised. Fortunately, many tasks of systematic reviews have the potential to be automated or may be assisted by automation. Recent advances in natural language processing, text mining and machine learning have produced new algorithms that can accurately mimic human endeavour in systematic review activity, faster and more cheaply. Automation tools need to be able to work together, to exchange data and results. Therefore, we initiated the International Collaboration for the Automation of Systematic Reviews (ICASR), to successfully put all the parts of automation of systematic review production together. The first meeting was held in Vienna in October 2015. We established a set of principles to enable tools to be developed and integrated into toolkits. This paper sets out the principles devised at that meeting, which cover the need for improvement in efficiency of SR tasks, automation across the spectrum of SR tasks, continuous improvement, adherence to high quality standards, flexibility of use and combining components, the need for a collaboration and varied skills, the desire for open source, shared code and evaluation, and a requirement for replicability through rigorous and open evaluation. Automation has a great potential to improve the speed of systematic reviews. Considerable work is already being done on many of the steps involved in a review. The 'Vienna Principles' set out in this paper aim to guide a more coordinated effort which will allow the integration of work by separate teams and build on the experience, code and evaluations done by the many teams working across the globe.},

abstract = {AbstractThis article traces how climate has moved from playing a deterministic to a reductionist role in discourses about environment, society, and the future. Climate determinism previously offered an explanation, and hence a justification, for the superiority of certain imperial races and cultures. The argument put forward here is that the new climate reductionism is driven by the hegemony exercised by the predictive natural sciences over contingent, imaginative, and humanistic accounts of social life and visions of the future. It is a hegemony that lends disproportionate power in political and social discourse to model-based descriptions of putative future climates. Some possible reasons for this climate reductionism, as well as some of the limitations and dangers of this position for human relationships with the future, are suggested.},

abstract = {How can assessments of environmental policy issues be policy-relevant without being policy-prescriptive? The predominant technocratic and decisionist responses to this question misleadingly assume that value-neutral scientific recommendations for public policy means, or even objectives, are possible. On the other end of the spectrum, the literature on democratic and pragmatic models of expertise in policy often does not satisfactorily explain what researchers can contribute to public discourses surrounding disputed, value-laden policy objectives and means. Building on John Dewey's philosophy, this article develops the "pragmatic-enlightened model" (PEM) of assessment making, which refines the existing pragmatic models. It is used to some extent by Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. According to the PEM's policy assessment methodology, policy objectives and their means can only be evaluated in light of the practical consequences of the means. Learning about the secondary effects, side effects and synergies of the best means may require a revaluation of the policy objectives, for instance, regarding the use of bioenergy for climate mitigation. Following the PEM, assessments would-based on a thorough problem analysis-explore alternative policy pathways, including their diverse practical consequences, overlaps and trade-offs, in cooperation with stakeholders. Such an arduous interdisciplinary cartography of multiple objectives, multi-functional policy means and the broad range of their quantitative and qualitative practical consequences may face considerable practical challenges and uncertainty. Yet, it could make assessments more policy-relevant and less prescriptive, and could effectively support a learning process about the political solution space.},

abstract = {The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the new international climate treaty could put 2015 into the history books as a defining year for setting human development on a more sustainable pathway. The global climate policy and SDG agendas are highly interconnected: the way that the climate problem is addressed strongly affects the prospects of meeting numerous other SDGs and vice versa. Drawing on existing scenario results from a recent energy-economy-climate model inter-comparison project, this letter analyses these synergies and (risk) trade-offs of alternative 2 °C pathways across indicators relevant for energy-related SDGs and sustainable energy objectives. We find that limiting the availability of key mitigation technologies yields some co-benefits and decreases risks specific to these technologies but greatly increases many others. Fewer synergies and substantial trade-offs across SDGs are locked into the system for weak short-term climate policies that are broadly in line with current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), particularly when combined with constraints on technologies. Lowering energy demand growth is key to managing these trade-offs and creating synergies across multiple energy-related SD dimensions. We argue that SD considerations are central for choosing socially acceptable 2 °C pathways: the prospects of meeting other SDGs need not dwindle and can even be enhanced for some goals if appropriate climate policy choices are made. Progress on the climate policy and SDG agendas should therefore be tracked within a unified framework.},

abstract = {Sudden, unprecedented electric blackouts and outages come as a dampener for a system that thrives on electrical energy. Reliability and efficiency are essential features for any power grid system. The conventional power grid systems are incapable of making use of real-time information from consumer side as well as the supply end for a more efficient transmission. Smart grid system, in which tremendous research has been done and which has been improvised manifold over the past decade, helps in meeting the incessant fluctuations in power demand from a huge consumer population. Smart grid brings about automation in managing the energy requirements using a two way interactive system, i.e. its ability to fetch information from the user and supply ends and utilize it to improve the overall reliability and efficiency of the transmission lines. Incorporating smart energy meters along with smart grid could come a long way in conserving electricity apart from removing manual energy meter reading from the scene. Smart meters supply the required data for the smart grid which helps the grid in providing an automated response. The paper elucidates how smart meters help in digitally tackling the issue of energy conservation in the consumer end and the utility end.},

abstract = {Many scientists write code as part of their research. Just as expriments are logged in laboratory notebooks, it is important to document the code you use for analysis. However, a few key problems can arise when iteratively developing code that make it difficult to document and track which code version was used to create each result. First, you often need to experiment with new ideas, such as adding new features to a script or increasing the speed of a slow step, but you do not want to risk breaking the currently working code. One often-utilized solution is to make a copy of the script before making new edits. However, this can quickly become a problem because it clutters your file system with uninformative filenames, e.g., analisys.sh, analysis{\_}02.sh, analysis{\_}03.sh, etc. It is difficult to remember the differences between the verions of the files and, more importantly, which version you used to produce specific results, especially if you return to the code months later. Second, you will likely share your code with multiple lab mates or collaborators, and they may have suggestions on how to improve it. If you email the code to multiple people, you will have to manually incorporate all the changes of them sends. Fortunately, software engineers have already developed software to manage these issues: version control. A version control system (VCS) allows you to track the iterative changes you make to your code, Thus, you can experiment with new ideas but always have the option to revert to a specific past version of the code you used to generate particular results. Furthermore, you can record messages as you save each successive version so that you (or anyone else) reviewing the development history of the code is able to understand the rationale for the given edits. It also facilitates collaboration. Using a VCS, your collaborators can make and save changes to the code, and you can automatically incorporate these changes to the main code base. The collaborative aspect is enhanced with the emergence of websites that host version-controlled code.},

@article{Larkin2017,
abstract = {ABSTRACTA cumulative emissions approach is increasingly used to inform mitigation policy. However, there are different interpretations of what ?2°C? implies. Here it is argued that cost-optimization models, commonly used to inform policy, typically underplay the urgency of 2°C mitigation. The alignment within many scenarios of optimistic assumptions on negative emissions technologies (NETs), with implausibly early peak emission dates and incremental short-term mitigation, delivers outcomes commensurate with 2°C commitments. In contrast, considering equity and socio-technical barriers to change, suggests a more challenging short-term agenda. To understand these different interpretations, short-term CO2 trends of the largest CO2 emitters, are assessed in relation to a constrained CO2 budget, coupled with a ?what if? assumption that negative emissions technologies fail at scale. The outcomes raise profound questions around high-level framings of mitigation policy. The article concludes that applying even weak equity criteria, challenges the feasibility of maintaining a 50{\%} chance of avoiding 2°C without urgent mitigation efforts in the short-term. This highlights a need for greater engagement with: (1) the equity dimension of the Paris Agreement, (2) the sensitivity of constrained carbon budgets to short-term trends and (3) the climate risks for society posed by an almost ubiquitous inclusion of NETs within 2°C scenarios.Policy relevanceSince the Paris meeting, there is increased awareness that most policy ?solutions? commensurate with 2°C include widespread deployment of negative emissions technologies (NETs). Yet much less is understood about that option?s feasibility, compared with near-term efforts to curb energy demand. Moreover, the many different ways in which key information is synthesized for policy makers, clouds the ability of policy makers to make informed decisions. This article presents an alternative approach to consider what the Paris Agreement implies, if NETs are unable to deliver more carbon sinks than sources. It illustrates the scale of the climate challenge for policy makers, particularly if the Agreement?s aim to address ?equity? is accounted for. Here it is argued that much more attention needs to be paid to what CO2 reductions can be achieved in the short-term, rather than taking a risk that could render the Paris Agreement?s policy goals unachievable.},

What is the place of digital humanities (DH) practice in the new social and geological era of the Anthropocene? What are the DH community's most significant responsibilities, and to whom? This talk positions itself in deep time, but strives for a foothold in the vital here-and-now of service to broad publics.

I discuss digital recovery and close reading of texts and artifacts once thought lost forever, and the ways that prosopography, graphesis, and distant reading open new vistas on the longue dur{\'{e}}e. Can DH develop a practical ethics of resilience and repair? Can it become more humane while working at inhuman scales? Can we resist narratives of progress, and still progress?

abstract = {Executive summary The Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change was established to provide an independent, global monitoring system dedicated to tracking the health dimensions of the impacts of, and the response to, climate change. The Lancet Countdown tracks 41 indicators across five domains: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability; adaptation, planning, and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; finance and economics; and public and political engagement. This report is the product of a collaboration of 27 leading academic institutions, the UN, and intergovernmental agencies from every continent. The report draws on world-class expertise from climate scientists, ecologists, mathematicians, geographers, engineers, energy, food, live stock, and transport experts, economists, social and poli tical scientists, public health professionals, and doctors. The Lancet Countdown's work builds on decades of research in this field, and was first proposed in the 2015 Lancet Commission on health and climate change, 1 which documented the human impacts of climate change and provided ten global recommendations to respond to this public health emergency and secure the public health benefits available (panel 1). The following four key messages derive from the Lancet Countdown's 2018 report: 1 Present day changes in heat waves, labour capacity, vector-borne disease, and food security provide early warning of the compounded and overwhelming impact on public health that are expected if temperatures continue to rise. Trends in climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerabilities show an unacceptably high level of risk for the current and future health of populations across the world. 2 A lack of progress in reducing emissions and building adaptive capacity threatens both human lives and the viability of the national health systems they depend on, with the potential to disrupt core public health infra structure and overwhelm health services. 3 Despite these delays, a number of sectors have seen the beginning of a low-carbon transition, and it is clear that the nature and scale of the response to climate change will be the determining factor in shaping the health of nations for centuries to come. 4 Ensuring a widespread understanding of climate change as a central public health issue will be crucial in delivering an accelerated response, with the health profession beginning to rise to this challenge.},

Previous social science research has explored media representations of climate change in various temporal and geographical contexts. Through the lens of Social Representations Theory, this article provides a detailed qualitative thematic analysis of media representations of climate change in the 1988 British broadsheet press, given that this year constitutes an important juncture in this transition of climate change from the domain of science to that of the socio-political sphere. The following themes are outlined: (i) "Climate change: a multi-faceted threat"; (ii) "Collectivisation of threat"; (iii) "Climate change and the attribution of blame"; and (iv) "Speculative solutions to a complex socio-environmental problem." The article provides detailed empirical insights into the "starting-point" for present-day disputes concerning climate change and lays the theoretical foundations for tracking the continuities and discontinuities characterising social representations of climate change in the future.},

abstract = {Decisions in policy and practice should always be based on the best available evidence, but synthesising the evidence is often considered an insurmountable task. Reviews aim to summarise (synthesise) the evidence in a form that is readily digestible by decision makers. Systematic reviews (SRs) are emerging as an important tool and industry standard in reviewing evidence across many disciplines. SRs are transparent, repeatable and objective, reducing bias and maximising reliability. SRs are typically much less susceptible to bias than traditional reviews, many meta-analyses and other syntheses as a result of strict guidelines and highly detailed a priori methods. SR began in medicine and revolutionised medical policy and practice by pooling disparate studies and identifying common trends that may be missed by individual studies. SRs are now also used in public health and in environmental and social sciences to aid in decision making. SR in environmental management was adapted in response to a need for answers to controversial questions, questions where doubt existed about the reliability of the evidence and where the evidence base appeared to lack consensus. SR is a valuable tool for any researcher provided they assemble the right team and have the necessary support available. They can complement longer postgraduate study and involve the development of valuable transferable skills including searching, critical appraisal, quantitative and qualitative analysis, scientific writing and science communication. Along with synthesising evidence to provide answers to questions, SRs can help in formulating hypotheses, identify knowledge gaps and highlight deficiencies in methodologies used in published research.},

abstract = {Literature reviews are essential for any researcher trying to keep up to date with the burgeoning software engineering literature. Finding relevant papers can be hard due to the huge amount of candidates provided by search. FAST 2 is a novel tool for assisting the researchers to find the next promising paper to read. This paper describes FAST 2 and tests it on four large systematic literature review datasets. We show that FAST 2 robustly optimizes the human effort to find most (95{\%}) of the relevant software engineering papers while also compensating for the errors made by humans during the review process. The effectiveness of FAST 2 can be attributed to three key innovations: (1) a novel way of applying external domain knowledge (a simple two or three keyword search) to guide the initial selection of papers—which helps to find relevant research papers faster with less variances; (2) an estimator of the number of remaining relevant papers yet to be found—which helps the reviewer decide when to stop the review; (3) a novel human error correction algorithm—which corrects a majority of human misclassifications (labeling relevant papers as non-relevant or vice versa) without imposing too much extra human effort.},

In the Synthesis Report, the certainty in key assessment findings is communicated as in the Working Group Reports and Special Reports. It is based on the author teams' evaluations of underlying scientific understanding and is expressed as a qualitative level of confidence (from very low to very high) and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantified likelihood (from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain)1 . Where appropriate, findings are also formulated as statements of fact with- out using uncertainty qualifiers.

However, the scale of this potential resource remains poorly understood because of uncertain land availability and yield expectations. Here, we used climate-constrained, satellite-derived net primary productivity data computed for 110 million square kilometers of terrestrial plant production as an upper-envelope constraint on primary bioenergy potential (PBP). We estimated the maximum PBP to realistically range from 12{\%} to 35{\%} of 2009 global primary energy consumption, with yield potential ranging from 6.6 to 18.8 megajoules per square meter per year—roughly four times lower than previous evaluations. Our results highlight many recent bioenergy evaluations as overoptimistic, which we attribute to a failure to adequately apply biophysical constraints in estimates of yield potential. We do not advocate bioenergy production at the levels reported in this analysis; instead, we simply report the ceiling for PBP based on current planetary productivity.},

To address this limitation, I introduce a statistical model that attends to the structure of political rhetoric when measuring expressed priorities: statements are naturally organized by author. The expressed agenda model exploits this structure to simultaneously estimate the topics in the texts, as well as the attention political actors allocate to the estimated topics. I apply the method to a collection of over 24,000 press releases from senators from 2007, which I demonstrate is an ideal medium to measure how senators explain their work in Washington to constituents. A set of examples validates the estimated priorities and demonstrates their usefulness for testing theories of how members of Congress communicate with constituents. The statistical model and its extensions will be made available in a forthcoming free software package for the R computing language.},

abstract = {Aspect-based opinion mining is widely applied to review data to aggregate or summarize opinions of a product, and the current state-of-the-art is achieved with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based model. Although social media data like tweets are laden with opinions, their "dirty" nature (as natural language) has discouraged researchers from applying LDA-based opinion model for product review mining. Tweets are often informal, unstructured and lacking labeled data such as categories and ratings, making it challenging for product opinion mining. In this paper, we propose an LDA-based opinion model named Twitter Opinion Topic Model (TOTM) for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. TOTM leverages hashtags, mentions, emoticons and strong sentiment words that are present in tweets in its discovery process. It improves opinion prediction by modeling the target-opinion interaction directly, thus discovering target specific opinion words, neglected in existing approaches. Moreover, we propose a new formulation of incorporating sentiment prior information into a topic model, by utilizing an existing public sentiment lexicon. This is novel in that it learns and updates with the data. We conduct experiments on 9 million tweets on electronic products, and demonstrate the improved performance of TOTM in both quantitative evaluations and qualitative analysis. We show that aspect-based opinion analysis on massive volume of tweets provides useful opinions on products.},

abstract = {Within the next years, consumer households will be increasingly equipped with smart metering and intelligent appliances. These technologies are the basis for households to better monitor electricity consumption and to actively control loads in private homes. Demand side management (DSM) can be adopted to private households. We present a simulation model that generates household load profiles under flat tariffs and simulates changes in these profiles when households are equipped with smart appliances and face time-based electricity prices.We investigate the impact of smart appliances and variable prices on electricity bills of a household. We show that for households the savings from equipping them with smart appliances are moderate compared to the required investment. This finding is quite robust with respect to variation of tariff price spreads and to different types of appliance utilization patterns.Finally, our results indicate that electric utilities may face new demand peaks when day-ahead hourly prices are applied. However, a considerable amount of residential load is available for shifting, which is interesting for the utilities to balance demand and supply. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The cDTM is a dynamic topic model that uses Brownian motion to model the latent topics through a sequential collection of documents, where a ``topic'' is a pattern of word use that we expect to evolve over the course of the col- lection. We derive an efficient variational approximate inference algorithm that takes advantage of the sparsity of observations in text, a property that lets us easily han- dle many time points. In contrast to the cDTM, the original discrete-time dynamic topic model (dDTM) requires that time be discretized. Moreover, the complexity of vari- ational inference for the dDTM grows quickly as time granularity increases, a drawback which limits fne-grained discretization. We demonstrate the cDTM on two news corpora, reporting both predictive perplexity and the novel task of time stamp prediction.},

Such negative emissions can be materialized when well-performing bioenergy systems are combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Here, we develop an integrated global energy system and climate model to evaluate the role of BECCS in reaching ambitious temperature targets. We present emission, concentration and temperature pathways towards 1.5 and 2 ° C targets. Our model results demonstrate that BECCS makes it feasible to reach temperature targets that are otherwise out of reach, provided that a temporary overshoot of the target is accepted. Additionally, stringent temperature targets can be met at considerably lower cost if BECCS is available. However, the economic benefit of BECCS nearly vanishes if an overshoot of the temperature target is not allowed. Finally, the least-cost emission pathway over the next 50 years towards a 1.5 ° C overshoot target with BECCS is almost identical to a pathway leading to a 2 ° C ceiling target. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {We describe an approach to CO(2) capture and storage from the atmosphere
that involves enhancing the solubility of CO(2) in the ocean by an
engineered process equivalent to the natural silicate weathering
process. HCl is electrochemically removed from the ocean and neutralized
through reaction with silicate rocks. The alkaline solution resulting
from the removal of HCl is neutralized by capturing atmospheric CO(2)
and is dissolved into the ocean where the carbon will be stored
primarily as HCO(3)(-) without further acidifying the ocean. On time
scales of hundreds of years or longer, some of the additional alkalinity
is expected to lead to precipitation or enhanced preservation of
CaCO(3), resulting in the permanent storage of the associated carbon,
and the return of an equal amount of carbon to the atmosphere. The
overall process is equivalent to the earth's natural chemical weathering
process of silicate rocks. Whereas the natural silicate weathering
process is effected primarily by carbonic acid, the engineered process
accelerates the weathering kinetics to industrial rates by replacing
this weak acid with HCl. In the thermodynamic limit-and with the
appropriate silicate rocks-the overall reaction is spontaneous. A range
of efficiency scenarios indicates that the process should require 100 -
400 kJ of work per mol of CO(2) captured and stored for relevant
timescales. The process can be powered from stranded energy sources too
remote to be useful for the direct needs of populations. (C) 2008

To mitigate this problem, there have been some attempts to leverage supervised machine learning to automate the article triage procedure. This approach has been proved to be helpful for updating existing systematic reviews. However, this technique holds very little promise for creating new reviews because training data is rarely available when it comes to systematic creation. In this research we assess and compare the applicability of semi-supervised learning to overcome this labeling bottleneck and support the creation of systematic reviews. The results indicated that semi-supervised learning could significantly reduce the human effort and is a viable technique for automating medical systematic review creation with a small-sized training dataset.},

abstract = {Power generation is one of the industrial sectors with major
contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. For climate change mitigation,
a special attention is given to the reduction of CO2 emissions by
applying capture and storage techniques in which CO2 is captured and
then stored in suitable safe geologic locations. Carbon capture and
storage (CCS) technologies are expected to play a significant role in
the coming decades for curbing greenhouse gas emissions and to ensure a
sustainable development of power generation and other energy-intensive
industrial sectors (e. g. cement, metallurgy, petro-chemical etc.).
This paper evaluates super-critical coal-based power plants with and
without carbon capture. The analysis is geared toward quantification of
main plant performance indicators such as: fuel consumption, gross and
net energy efficiency, ancillary energy consumption, carbon capture
rate, specific CO2 emissions, capital costs, specific capital
investments and operational costs etc. For CCS configurations, two
post-combustion CO2 capture options were considered. The first option is
based gas-liquid absorption using a chemical solvent
(methyl-diethanol-amine - MDEA etc.). The second option is based on
calcium looping cycle, in which the carbonation/calcination sequence of
CaO/CaCO3 system is used for carbon capture.
The power plant case studies investigated in the paper produces around
950 - 1,100 MW net power with at least 90 {\%} carbon capture rate. The
mathematical modelling and simulation of the whole power generation
schemes will produce the input data for quantitative techno-economic and
environmental evaluations of power plants with carbon capture (similar
power plant concept without CCS was used as reference for comparison).
Mass and energy integration tools were used to assess the integration
aspects of evaluated carbon capture options in the whole power plant
design, to optimise the overall energy efficiency and to evaluate the
main sources of energy penalty for CCS designs.},

They are now an integral part of the agenda of governments and corporations, and their goals have become central to the mission of research laboratories and universities worldwide. However, it remains unclear how far the field has progressed as a scientific discipline, especially given its ambitious agenda of integrating theory, applied science, and policy, making it relevant for development globally and generating a new interdisciplinary synthesis across fields. To address these questions, we assembled a corpus of scholarly publications in the field and analyzed its temporal evolution, geographic distribution, disciplinary composition, and collaboration structure. We show that sustainability science has been growing explosively since the late 1980s when foundational publications in the field increased its pull on new authors and intensified their interactions. The field has an unusual geographic footprint combining contributions and connecting through collaboration cities and nations at very different levels of development. Its decomposition into traditional disciplines reveals its emphasis on the management of human, social, and ecological systems seen primarily from an engineering and policy perspective. Finally, we show that the integration of these perspectives has created a new field only in recent years as judged by the emergence of a giant component of scientific collaboration. These developments demonstrate the existence of a growing scientific field of sustainability science as an unusual, inclusive and ubiquitous scientific practice and bode well for its continued impact and longevity.},

abstract = {Abstract Current examples of these priorities include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving the energy efficiency, energy marketing, energy cost, energy planning and management, energy security, energy policy, energy strategy, and alternative energy usage. The demand for energy is increasing at a significant rate due to the exponential growth of world population. Advanced energy-efficiency technologies reduce the energy needed to provide energy services, thereby reducing environmental and national security costs of using energy and potentially increasing its reliability. Energy conservation is needed for improved energy efficiency, improved insulation and heat recovery, effective energy usage, process change and improvement, and good maintenance of machinery and equipment.},

abstract = {In a rapidly changing world, characterized by novel ecological scenarios and fluctuating socioeconomic and ecological demands, ecological restoration practices must constantly adapt to emerging issues and circumstances. Restoration ecology, the scientific discipline that informs ecological restoration, must therefore evolve and expand its focus to address this need. To describe and evaluate the evolution of research pertaining to the ecological restoration of forests within the field of forestry, we performed a review of all 29,766 abstracts published over the last 35 years (1980–2014) in 15 leading forestry journals using automated content analysis, a machine learning-based tool for automated review of large volumes of literature (“big literature”). We found not only a 50-fold increase in the prominence of restoration ecology in forestry literature from 2000 to 2013, but also an evolution in the focus of forest restoration research. This evolution is likely in response to emerging topics and issues affecting forest restoration, such as exotic species, altered disturbance regimes, degraded tropical forests, and ecosystem services. Our results also revealed a pattern of “cyclic development,” in which research in the 1990s was focused on constructing theoretical frameworks, in the 2000s research appeared to be concentrated on restoration practices and programs, while in the 2010s research revisited established theoretical frameworks, possibly indicating a conceptual expansion. Our study highlighted gaps in research on important topics and emerging challenges, such as global climate change, genetic considerations, landscape-level factors, and restoring degraded systems, thus pointing the way for new and necessary research directions.},

abstract = {Active learning (AL) is an increasingly popular strategy for mitigating the amount of labeled data required to train clas- sifiers, thereby reducing annotator effort. We describe a real-world, deployed application of AL to the problem of biomedical citation screening for systematic reviews at the Tufts Medical Center's Evidence-based Practice Center. We propose a novel active learning strategy that exploits a priori domain knowledge provided by the expert (specifically, la- beled features) and extend this model via a Linear Program- ming algorithm for situations where the expert can provide ranked labeled features. Our methods outperform existing AL strategies on three real-world systematic review datasets. We argue that evaluation must be specific to the scenario under consideration. To this end, we propose a new evalua- tion framework for finite-pool scenarios, wherein the primary aim is to label a fixed set of examples rather than to sim- ply induce a good predictive model. We use a method from medical decision theory for eliciting the relative costs of false positives and false negatives from the domain expert, con- structing a utility measure of classification performance that integrates the expert preferences. Our findings suggest that the expert can, and should, provide more information than instance labels alone. In addition to achieving strong em- pirical results on the citation screening problem, this work outlines many important steps for moving away from simu- lated active learning and toward deploying AL for real-world applications.},

abstract = {High cost for systematic review of biomedical literature has generated interest in decreasing overall workload. This can be done by applying natural language processing techniques to 'automate' the classification of publications that are potentially relevant for a given question. Existing solutions need training using a specific supervised machine-learning algorithm and feature-extraction system separately for each systematic review. We propose a system that only uses the input and feedback of human reviewers during the course of review. As the reviewers classify articles, the query is modified using a simple relevance feedback algorithm, and the semantically closest document to the query is presented. An evaluation of our approach was performed using a set of 15 published drug systematic reviews. The number of articles that needed to be reviewed was substantially reduced (ranging from 6{\%} to 30{\%} for a 95{\%} recall).},

abstract = {Recent controversy has led to calls for increased standardization and transparency in the methods used to synthesize climate change research. Though these debates have focused largely on the biophysical dimen- sions of climate change, human dimensions research is equally in need of improved methodological approaches for research synthesis. Systematic review approaches, and more recently realist review methods, have been used within the health sciences for decades to guide research synthesis. Despite this, penetration of these approaches into the social and environmental sciences has been limited. Here, we present an analysis of approaches for systematic review and research synthesis and examine their applica- bility in an adaptation context. Customized review frame- works informed by systematic approaches to research synthesis provide a conceptually appropriate and practical opportunity for increasing methodological transparency and rigor in synthesizing and tracking adaptation research. This review highlights innovative applications of system- atic approaches, with a focus on the unique challenges of integrating multiple data sources and formats in reviewing climate change adaptation policy and practice. We present guidelines, key considerations, and recommendations for systematic review in the social sciences in general and adaptation research in particular. We conclude by calling for increased conceptual and methodological development of systematic review approaches to address the methodo- logical challenges of synthesizing and tracking adaptation to climate change.},

abstract = {Over the past decades, numerous science institutions have evolved around issues of global sustainability, aiming to inform and shape societal transformations towards sustainability. While these science-based initiatives seem to take on an ever growing active role in governance for sustainable development, the question arises how they can claim any political authority in the first place. We present here a structured comparison of six international science-based initiatives, all engaged in governance processes related to the recently established Sustainable Development Goals. We focus on the material and rhetorical strategies employed by these science institutions to acquire authority by fostering perceptions of salience, credibility and legitimacy among governance actors. We distinguish three modes of scientific authority: an assessment-oriented mode that combines a strategy of salience through integration, with credibility by formal mechanisms of review, and legitimacy through representation; an advice-oriented mode, which appeals to salience through the promise of independent and timely science advice, to credibility through the credentials of the scientists involved, and to legitimacy through formal recognition by governance actors; and a solution-oriented mode, with science institutions claiming relevance based on the promise to contribute to solutions for global sustainability, while credibility is sought by invoking support of the scientific community, and legitimacy through a strategy of participation. Based on this analysis, we provide a framework for reflection on the claims and strategies of science-based initiatives, and their role and responsibility in governance for sustainable development.This article is part of a special issue on solution-oriented GEAs.},

The model represents words and contexts by latent trajectories in an embedding space. At each moment in time, the embedding vectors are inferred from a probabilistic version of word2vec [Mikolov et al., 2013]. These embedding vectors are connected in time through a latent diffusion process. We describe two scalable variational inference algorithms--skip-gram smoothing and skip-gram filtering--that allow us to train the model jointly over all times; thus learning on all data while simultaneously allowing word and context vectors to drift. Experimental results on three different corpora demonstrate that our dynamic model infers word embedding trajectories that are more interpretable and lead to higher predictive likelihoods than competing methods that are based on static models trained separately on time slices.},

abstract = {The Zika virus (ZIKV) was first found in Zika forest, Uganda in 1947. The disease appeared in the Americas, Northeast Brazil in May 2015. ZIKV propagated rapidly across the Americas and the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2016 declared this as a public health emergency of international concern. The temperature conditions related to extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o of 2015–16 were exceptionally favorable for ZIKV spreading in South America. For the recent spreading of ZIKV, in Americas, Northeast Brazil was the starting point and it was associated with the extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o 2015–16. Paz and Semenza found that there is a striking overlap when the regions with extreme climatic conditions in 1 month are juxtaposed with the geographic distribution of ZIKV in subsequent months. They found that the unique climatic conditions generated by extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o of 2015–16 are congenial for the dispersal of ZIKV in the Americas. This is not a just coincidence and many authors noted that ZIKV vector Aedes aegypti is strongly dependent on surface climate conditions that occur during extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o events. Recently a study found that extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o events will double in future in response to greenhouse warming. Also it was discovered that the increase of extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o frequency will continue long after 1.5 °C warming stabilization. We analyze future extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o events along with associated surface temperatures and calculated the ZIKV quantitatively in future extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o events and found that large parts of South America are highly favorable for the spread of the disease.},

abstract = {Debates on climate change, energy and food security concerns have underscored the need for new methods and tools to explore and understand the complexity of these relevant issues. In this study, we used unsupervised probabilistic modeling—latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)—to examine the changes in social policy debates related to ethanol production in Brazil and its relationship with climate change and food security. We analyze a large amount of data obtained from Brazilian newspapers, government and business documents, and the bulletins of nongovernmental organizations and social movements from 2007 through 2017. The results from the LDA application allowed us to identify key topics, detect novel trends, and follow them through time, in addition to exhibiting the limitations encountered in identifying social actor discourses. To overcome these limitations, we combine LDA and discourse analysis to enable the construction of topics, concepts, and discourses of the actors surrounding the issue of this study. The findings verify the utility of these techniques by emphasizing the themes and discourses of the actors involved and by identifying the determinant positions of the Brazilian actors in the discussions on ethanol production and its competition with food security and the contributions of ethanol as a renewable energy source to mitigate climate change. This finding provides insights for water–energy–food nexus research.},

abstract = {Collection and especially analysis of open-ended survey responses are relatively rare in the discipline and when conducted are almost exclusively done through human coding. We present an alternative, semiautomated approach, the structural topic model (STM) (Roberts, Stewart, andAiroldi 2013; Roberts et al. 2013), that draws on recent developments in machine learning based analysis of textual data. A crucial contribution of the method is that it incorporates information about the document, such as the author's gender, political affiliation, and treatment assignment (if an experimental study). This article focuses on how the STMis helpful for survey researchers and experimentalists. The STM makes analyzing open-ended responses easier, more revealing, and capable of being used to estimate treatment effects. We illustrate these innovations with analysis of text from surveys and experiments.},

In this Perspective, we discuss the potential contribution of carbon capture and utilization (CCU). Owing to the scale and rate of CO2 production compared to that of utilization allowing long-term sequestration, it is highly improbable the chemical conversion of CO2 will account for more than 1{\%} of the mitigation challenge, and even a scaled-up enhanced oil recovery (EOR)-CCS industry will likely only account for 4-8{\%}. Therefore, whilst CO2-EOR may be an important economic incentive for some early CCS projects, CCU may prove to be a costly distraction, financially and politically, from the real task of mitigation.},

abstract = {The key idea behind active learning is that a machine learning algorithm can achieve greater accuracy with fewer training labels if it is allowed to choose the data from which it learns. An active learner may pose queries, usually in the form of unlabeled data instances to be labeled by an oracle (e.g., a human annotator). Active learning is well-motivated in many modern machine learning problems, where unlabeled data may be abundant or easily obtained, but labels are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain. This report provides a general introduction to active learning and a survey of the literature. This includes a discussion of the scenarios in which queries can be formulated, and an overview of the query strategy frameworks proposed in the literature to date. An analysis of the empirical and theoretical evidence for successful active learning, a summary of problem setting variants and practical issues, and a discussion of related topics in machine learning research are also presented.},

abstract = {Olivine sand is a natural mineral, which, when added to soil, can
improve the soil's mechanical properties while also sequester carbon
dioxide (CO2) from the surrounding environment. The originality of this
paper stems from the novel two-stage approach. In the first stage,
natural carbonation of olivine and carbonation of olivine treated soil
under different CO2 pressures and times were investigated. In this
stage, the unconfined compression test was used as a tool to evaluate
the strength performance. In the second stage, details of the
installation and performance of carbonated olivine columns using a
laboratory-scale model were investigated. In this respect, olivine was
mixed with the natural soil using the auger and the columns were then
carbonated with gaseous CO2. The unconfined compressive strengths of
soil in the first stage increased by up to 120{\%} compared to those of
the natural untreated soil. The strength development was found to be
proportional to the CO2 pressure and carbonation period. Microstructural
analyses indicated the presence of magnesite on the surface of
carbonated olivinetreated soil, demonstrating that modified physical
properties provided a stronger and stiffer matrix. The performance of
the carbonated olivine-soil columns, in terms of ultimate bearing
capacity, showed that the carbonation procedure occurred rapidly and
yielded a bearing capacity value of 120 kPa. Results of this study are
of significance to the construction industry as the feasibility of
carbonated olivine for strengthening and stabilizing soil is validated.
Its applicability lies in a range of different geotechnical applications
whilst also mitigates the global warming through the sequestration of

abstract = {Most US consumers are charged a near-constant retail price for electricity, despite substantial hourly variation in the wholesale market price. This paper evaluates a randomized experiment that exposed households to hourly real time pricing (RTP) and applies the demand estimates to counterfactual simulations in a structural model of the Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland electricity market. The model includes a dierent approach to the problem of multiple equilibria in multi-unit auctions: I non-parametrically estimate unobservables that rationalize past bidding behavior and use learning algorithms to move from the observed equilibrium counterfactual bid functions. This routine is nested as the second stage of a static entry model that captures an important institution called the Capacity Market, which acts in equilibrium as a minimum constraint on system capacity and transfers the shadow price to capacity owners. There are four central results. First, the experimentis net eect on consumer behavior was energy conservation during peak hours, not substitution from peak to o-peak. Second, I detail plausible conditions under which large scale RTP could actually increase wholesale electricity prices in peak hours, contrary to predictions from short run models, while decreasing Capacity Market prices and total entry. Third, although the increased demand elasticity from RTP reduces producersimarket power, in practice this would be a second-order channel of efficiency gains. Fourth, I Ond that the welfare gains from residential RTP are likely, but not certain, to outweigh the costs of the required hourly electricity meters.},

abstract = {Bio-chemical processes have recently become the core of several studies
in the geoengineering field, where the emphasis is placed on new and
emerging applications. Microbially Induced Calcite Precipitation has
been introduced as an alternative cementation mechanism for soils, and
it is studied for its potential to offer substantial and
environment-friendly solutions for soil improvement. In this paper, we
focus on the microstructural characteristics of the new geo-material,
which is engineered after harnessing a treatment process including
multiple injections of bacteria and chemical solutions, which ultimately
induce the formulation of calcite particles inside the soil matrix.
Obtaining detailed knowledge of the local structural properties of the
precipitated nuclei is considered an essential factor because calcite
particles affect the macroscopic mechanical response with the foreseen
increase in strength and stiffness, which are attributed to the
precipitated mass and its geometrical arrangement. The main objective of
this study is to elucidate the role of the calcium chloride
concentration on the yielded precipitation and clarify some of the
predominant fabric characteristics of the new structure. For this
purpose, microstructural observations with Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM) were used. Here, calcite mesocrystals, i.e., aggregates of single
particles, are identified as a distinct form of precipitates that
provide the crucial grain-to-grain contact surfaces. The cemented
samples were subsequently subjected to undrained triaxial shear. The
results show the increase in peak strength at low strains, followed by a
brittle fracture and post-yield softening.},

abstract = {Systematic mapping was developed in social sciences in response to a lack of empirical data when answering questions using systematic review methods, and a need for a method to describe the literature across a broad subject of interest. Systematic mapping does not attempt to answer a specific question as do systematic reviews, but instead collates, describes and catalogues available evidence (e.g. primary, secondary, theoretical, economic) relating to a topic or question of interest. The included studies can be used to identify evidence for policy-relevant questions, knowledge gaps (to help direct future primary research) and knowledge clusters (sub-sets of evidence that may be suitable for secondary research, for example systematic review). Evidence synthesis in environmental sciences faces similar challenges to those found in social sciences. Here we describe the translation of systematic mapping methodology from social sciences for use in environmental sciences. We provide the first process-based methodology for systematic maps, describing the stages involved: establishing the review team and engaging stakeholders; setting the scope and question; setting inclusion criteria for studies; scoping stage; protocol development and publication; searching for evidence; screening evidence; coding; production of a systematic map database; critical appraisal (optional); describing and visualising the findings; report production and supporting information. We discuss the similarities and differences in methodology between systematic review and systematic mapping and provide guidance for those choosing which type of synthesis is most suitable for their requirements. Furthermore, we discuss the merits and uses of systematic mapping and make recommendations for improving this evolving methodology in environmental sciences.},

A typical task is to ‘map' the literature addressing a specific clinical question, i.e., (i) identify as many relevant articles of interest as feasible under a constrained budget, and (ii) estimate how many such articles likely exist. These are com- peting objectives. Using active retrieval strategies (e.g., ac- tive learning) to realize the former aim immediately hinders our ability to achieve the latter: ‘naive' estimates of the amount of relevant articles taken over an enriched sampled acquired through selective sampling will be inflated. We propose a novel method for correcting such estimates. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on three system- atic review datasets, showing that we can achieve both aims: rapid evidence discovery and acceptably accurate estimation of the number of relevant articles.},

abstract = {In the last decades the application of rock powder or comparable
products on soils has increased in agriculture areas leading to
additional release of elements and alteration of soil solutions and
saturation states of solutes. In the future this practice will continue
and areas affected will spread. This trend will likely be fuelled by
attempts to optimize carbon dioxide removal by increasing biomass
production, soil organic carbon stocks, increase crop production or
afforestation. All those efforts demand a certain amount of geogenic
nutrients, which need to be replaced. To investigate the release
patterns and the downward transport of an array of elements, and to
study their fate as well as reaction processes, altered through this
practice, a mesocosm experiment was established at Antwerp University.
Here, first results are shown focusing on the release and transport of
DIC and Mg in the soil downwards after the application of 22 kg m(-2)
olivine powder with a grain size smaller than 63 mu m on average.
Elevated DIC and Mg concentrations are detected in case of olivine is
applied to mesocosms with wheat and barley, if compared to the mesocsoms
without plants, and without olivine. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Systematic mapping was developed in social sciences in response to a lack of empirical data when answering questions using systematic review methods, and a need for a method to describe the literature across a broad subject of interest. Systematic mapping does not attempt to answer a specific question as do systematic reviews, but instead collates, describes and catalogues available evidence (e.g. primary, secondary, theoretical, economic) relating to a topic or question of interest. The included studies can be used to identify evidence for policy-relevant questions, knowledge gaps (to help direct future primary research) and knowledge clusters (sub-sets of evidence that may be suitable for secondary research, for example systematic review). Evidence synthesis in environmental sciences faces similar challenges to those found in social sciences. Here we describe the translation of systematic mapping methodology from social sciences for use in environmental sciences. We provide the first process-based methodology for systematic maps, describing the stages involved: establishing the review team and engaging stakeholders; setting the scope and question; setting inclusion criteria for studies; scoping stage; protocol development and publication; searching for evidence; screening evidence; coding; production of a systematic map database; critical appraisal (optional); describing and visualising the findings; report production and supporting information. We discuss the similarities and differences in methodology between systematic review and systematic mapping and provide guidance for those choosing which type of synthesis is most suitable for their requirements. Furthermore, we discuss the merits and uses of systematic mapping and make recommendations for improving this evolving methodology in environmental sciences.},

abstract = {Whether there is sufficient geologic CO2 storage capacity to allow CCS to play a significant role in mitigating climate change has been the subject of debate since the 1990s. This paper presents a meta- Analysis of a large body of recently published literature to derive updated estimates of the global deep geologic storage resource as well as the potential demand for this geologic CO2 storage resource over the course of this century. This analysis reveals that, for greenhouse gas emissions mitigation scenarios that have end-of-century atmospheric CO2 concentrations of between 350 ppmv and 725 ppmv, the average demand for deep geologic CO2 storage over the course of this century is between 410 GtCO2 and 1,670 GtCO2. The literature summarized here suggests that - depending on the stringency of criteria applied to calculate storage capacity - global geologic CO2 storage capacity could be: 35,300 GtCO2 of "theoretical" capacity; 13,500 GtCO2 of "effective" capacity; 3,900 GtCO2, of "practical" capacity; and 290 GtCO2 of "matched" capacity for the few regions where this narrow definition of capacity has been calculated. The cumulative demand for geologic CO2 storage is likely quite small compared to global estimates of the deep geologic CO2 storage capacity, and therefore, a "lack" of deep geologic CO2 storage capacity is unlikely to be an impediment for the commercial adoption of CCS technologies in this century.},

abstract = {With the Paris Agreement's ambition of limiting climate change to well below 2 °C, negative emission technologies (NETs) have moved into the limelight of discussions in climate science and policy. Despite several assessments, the current knowledge on NETs is still diffuse and incomplete, but also growing fast. Here, we synthesize a comprehensive body of NETs literature, using scientometric tools and performing an in-depth assessment of the quantitative and qualitative evidence therein. We clarify the role of NETs in climate change mitigation scenarios, their ethical implications, as well as the challenges involved in bringing the various NETs to the market and scaling them up in time. There are six major findings arising from our assessment: first, keeping warming below 1.5 °C requires the large-scale deployment of NETs, but this dependency can still be kept to a minimum for the 2 °C warming limit. Second, accounting for economic and biophysical limits, we identify relevant potentials for all NETs except ocean fertilization. Third, any single NET is unlikely to sustainably achieve the large NETs deployment observed in many 1.5 °C and 2 °C mitigation scenarios. Yet, portfolios of multiple NETs, each deployed at modest scales, could be invaluable for reaching the climate goals. Fourth, a substantial gap exists between the upscaling and rapid diffusion of NETs implied in scenarios and progress in actual innovation and deployment. If NETs are required at the scales currently discussed, the resulting urgency of implementation is currently neither reflected in science nor policy. Fifth, NETs face severe barriers to implementation and are only weakly incentivized so far. Finally, we identify distinct ethical discourses relevant for NETs, but highlight the need to root them firmly in the available evidence in order to render such discussions relevant in practice.},

abstract = {There has been much debate about the assessment process of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Yet two of the most fundamental challenges that directly threaten the ability of the IPCC to fulfill its mandate have been largely neglected so far. Firstly, the magnitude and rapid expansion of the climate change literature makes it increasingly impossible for the IPCC to conduct comprehensive and transparent assessments without major innovations in assessment practices and tools. Secondly, the structure, organization and scientific practices across the social sciences and humanities prohibit systematic learning on climate change solutions and increasingly limit the policy-relevance of IPCC assessments. We highlight the need for responses along three avenues to prepare the IPCC for continued success in the future: 1) IPCC assessments must make better use of big-data methods and available computational power to assess the growing body of literature and ensure comprehensiveness; 2) systematic review practices need to be enshrined into IPCC procedures to ensure adequate focus and transparency in its assessments; 3) a synthetic research culture needs to be established in the social sciences and humanities in order to foster knowledge accumulation and learning on climate solutions in the future. As policymakers become more interested in understanding solutions, the future prospects of global environmental assessment enterprises will depend heavily on a successful transformation within the social sciences and humanities towards systematic knowledge generation.

The results suggest that the carbon consumption tax scenarios would reduce GHG emissions by a greater quantity relative to the ad-valorem tax scenario; however, the intake of important nutrients will also decrease in these scenarios. Therefore, creating an environmentally sustainable and nutritious diet through taxation is challenging and requires compromise between the nutrition and environmental sustainability.},

A topological clustering method is used to detect the subdomains of sustainability science. Results show the existence of 15 main research clusters: Agriculture, Fisheries, Ecological Economics, Forestry (agroforestry), Forestry (tropical rain forest), Business, Tourism, Water, Forestry (biodiversity), Urban Planning, Rural Sociology, Energy, Health, Soil, and Wildlife. Agriculture, Fisheries, Ecological Economics, and Forestry (agroforestry) clusters are predominant among these. The Energy cluster is currently developing, as indicated by the age of papers in the cluster, although it has a relatively small number of papers. These results are compared with those obtained by natural language processing. Education, Biotechnology, Medical, Livestock, Climate Change, Welfare, and Livelihood clusters are uniquely extracted by natural language processing, because they are common topics across clusters in the citation network.},

abstract = {— Sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) aims to factorize a data matrix into two optimized nonnegative sparse factor matrices, which could benefit many tasks, such as document-word co-clustering. However, the traditional SNMF typically assumes the number of latent factors (i.e., dimension-ality of the factor matrices) to be fixed. This assumption makes it inflexible in practice. In this paper, we propose a doubly sparse nonparametric NMF framework to mitigate this issue by using dependent Indian buffet processes (dIBP). We apply a correlation function for the generation of two stick weights associated with each column pair of factor matrices while still maintaining their respective marginal distribution specified by IBP. As a consequence, the generation of two factor matrices will be columnwise correlated. Under this framework, two classes of correlation function are proposed: 1) using bivariate Beta distribution and 2) using Copula function. Compared with the single IBP-based NMF, this paper jointly makes two factor matrices nonparametric and sparse, which could be applied to broader scenarios, such as co-clustering. This paper is seen to be much more flexible than Gaussian process-based and hierarchial Beta process-based dIBPs in terms of allowing the two corresponding binary matrix columns to have greater variations in their nonzero entries. Our experiments on synthetic data show the merits of this paper compared with the state-of-the-art models in respect of factorization efficiency, sparsity, and flexibility. Experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate the efficiency of this paper in document-word co-clustering tasks.},

Here, land-based biological CDR and storage methods are reviewed, including afforestation, biomass burial, biochar production and bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage. The current and future CDR flux they could generate and their total storage capacity for CO2 are quantitatively assessed. The results suggest that there is already the potential to counterbalance land use change CO2 emissions. By mid-century, the CDR flux together with natural sinks could match current total CO2 emissions, thus stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentration. By the end of the century, CDR could exceed CO2 emissions, thus lowering atmospheric CO2 concentration and global temperature.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine whether a factorized version of the complement na{\"{i}}ve Bayes (FCNB) classifier can reduce the time spent by experts reviewing journal articles for inclusion in systematic reviews of drug class efficacy for disease treatment. Design: The proposed classifier was evaluated on a test collection built from 15 systematic drug class reviews used in previous work. The FCNB classifier was constructed to classify each article as containing highquality, drug class-specific evidence or not. Weight engineering (WE) techniques were added to reduce underestimation for Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)-based and Publication Type (PubType)-based features. Cross-validation experiments were performed to evaluate the classifier's parameters and performance. Measurements: Work saved over sampling (WSS) at no less than a 95{\%} recall was used as the main measure of performance. Results: The minimum workload reduction for a systematic review for one topic, achieved with a FCNB/WE classifier, was 8.5{\%}; the maximum was 62.2{\%} and the average over the 15 topics was 33.5{\%}. This is 15.0{\%} higher than the average workload reduction obtained using a voting perceptron-based automated citation classification system. Conclusion: The FCNB/WE classifier is simple, easy to implement, and produces significantly better results in reducing the workload than previously achieved. The results support it being a useful algorithm for machinelearning-based automation of systematic reviews of drug class efficacy for disease treatment.},

abstract = {Cities are key for achieving the 1.5 °C warming limit of the Paris Agreement. However, synthesizing policy insights from the urban literature is a challenge, due to its rapid growth, breadth of topics and relative lack of assessments so far. Here we introduce methods from computational linguistics to build a systematic overview of research on transport, buildings, waste management and urban form. We find that the epistemic core of the mitigation-focused urban literature is currently centered on urban form and emissions accounting, while extensive research into demand-side options remain overlooked, including congestion and parking polices, active travel, and waste management. In the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 °C, and for meeting the target itself, all such city-scale opportunities need to be examined.},

abstract = {Global environmental change is increasingly understood to have causes, consequences, and responses which span multiple levels, from the local to the global. The multi-level nature of such problems has required a radical shift in the relationship between knowledge and action. This working paper illustrates that in an era of global change which is inexorably linked with local ecosystems and communities, successful efforts of regional assessments which address large-scale environmental change can be characterized as distributed research, assessment, and decision support systems. Such systems share a number of characteristics. They: 1) integrate research, assessment, and decision-making across multiple levels; 2) are structured to assess and address global change in the context of local consequences; 3) identify, assess, and respond to the interactions between society and environment which cross levels; and 4) structure the relationship between decision-makers and researchers as a two-way, dynamic, and iterated process (not a "pipeline" from science to decision-maker).},

This joint Nature Energy and Nature Climate Change Collection illustrates how understanding and addressing these problems will require an integrated science of coupled human and natural systems; including technological systems, but also extending well beyond the domain of engineering or even economics. It demonstrates the value of replacing the stylized assumptions about human behaviour that are common in policy analysis, with ones based on data-driven science. We draw from and engage articles in the Collection to identify key contributions to understanding non-technological factors connecting economic activity and greenhouse gas emissions, describe a multi-dimensional space of human action on climate and energy issues, and illustrate key themes, dimensions and contributions towards fundamental understanding and informed decision making. {\textcopyright} 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {This study demonstrates that IPCC Third Assessment Report is strongly dominated by Natural sciences, especially the Earth sciences. The Social sciences are dominated by Economics. The IPCC assessment also results in the separation of the Earth, Biological and Social sciences. The integration that occurs is mainly between closely related scientific fields. The research community consequently imposes a physical and economic bias and a separation of scientific fields that the IPCC reproduces in the policy sphere. It is argued that this physical and economic bias distorts a comprehensive understanding of climate change and that the weak integration of scientific fields hinders climate change from being fully addressed as an integral environmental and social problem. If climate change is to be understood, evaluated and responded to in its fullness, the IPCCmust broaden its knowledge base and challenge the anthropocentric worldview that places humans outside of nature.},

abstract = {Machine learning tools can expedite systematic review (SR) processes by semi-automating citation screening. Abstrackr semi-automates citation screening by predicting relevant records. We evaluated its performance for four screening projects. We used a convenience sample of screening projects completed at the Alberta Research Centre for Health Evidence, Edmonton, Canada: three SRs and one descriptive analysis for which we had used SR screening methods. The projects were heterogeneous with respect to search yield (median 9328; range 5243 to 47,385 records; interquartile range (IQR) 15,688 records), topic (Antipsychotics, Bronchiolitis, Diabetes, Child Health SRs), and screening complexity. We uploaded the records to Abstrackr and screened until it made predictions about the relevance of the remaining records. Across three trials for each project, we compared the predictions to human reviewer decisions and calculated the sensitivity, specificity, precision, false negative rate, proportion missed, and workload savings. Abstrackr's sensitivity was {\textgreater} 0.75 for all projects and the mean specificity ranged from 0.69 to 0.90 with the exception of Child Health SRs, for which it was 0.19. The precision (proportion of records correctly predicted as relevant) varied by screening task (median 26.6{\%}; range 14.8 to 64.7{\%}; IQR 29.7{\%}). The median false negative rate (proportion of records incorrectly predicted as irrelevant) was 12.6{\%} (range 3.5 to 21.2{\%}; IQR 12.3{\%}). The workload savings were often large (median 67.2{\%}, range 9.5 to 88.4{\%}; IQR 23.9{\%}). The proportion missed (proportion of records predicted as irrelevant that were included in the final report, out of the total number predicted as irrelevant) was 0.1{\%} for all SRs and 6.4{\%} for the descriptive analysis. This equated to 4.2{\%} (range 0 to 12.2{\%}; IQR 7.8{\%}) of the records in the final reports. Abstrackr's reliability and the workload savings varied by screening task. Workload savings came at the expense of potentially missing relevant records. How this might affect the results and conclusions of SRs needs to be evaluated. Studies evaluating Abstrackr as the second reviewer in a pair would be of interest to determine if concerns for reliability would diminish. Further evaluations of Abstrackr's performance and usability will inform its refinement and practical utility.},

The implications of climate change for the environment and society will depend not only on the response of the Earth system to changes in radiative forcings, but also on how humankind responds through changes in technology, economies, lifestyle and policy. Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options. To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists. Here we describe a new process for creating plausible scenarios to investigate some of the most challenging and important questions about climate change confronting the global community.},

We argue that the incipient shift from traditional media toward user-driven social media brings with it new media dynamics, relocating the (re)production of societal discourses and power structures and thus bringing about new ways in which discursive power is exercised. This clearly motivates the need to critically engage this field. Our research is based on the analysis of a corpus consisting of over 50 million posts, collected from the forum using custom web crawlers. In order to approach this vast material of unstructured text, we suggest a novel methodological synergy combining critical discourse analysis (CDA) and topic modeling – a type of statistical model for the automated categorization of large quantities of texts developed in computer science. By rendering an overview or ‘content map' of the corpus, topic modeling provides an enriching complement to CDA, aiding discovery and adding analytical rigor. },

Under hypergeometric sampling, methodology is developed which quantifies the amount of information provided by the sample data relative to that provided by the prior distribution and allows for a ranking of prior distributions with respect to conservativeness, where conservatism refers to restraint of extraneous information embedded in any prior distribution. The most conservative prior distribution from a specified class (each member of which carries the available prior information) is that prior distribution within the class over which the likelihood function has the greatest average domination. Four different families of prior distributions are developed by considering a Bayesian approach to the formation of lots. The most conservative prior distribution from each of the four families of prior distributions is determined and compared for the situation when no prior information is available. The results of the comparison advocate the use of the Polya (beta-binomial) prior distribution in hypergeometric sampling.},

abstract = {Encouraging sustainable mobility patterns is at the forefront of policymaking at all scales of governance as the collective consciousness surrounding climate change continues to expand. Not every community, however, possesses the necessary economic or socio-cultural capital to encourage modal shifts away from private motorized vehicles towards active modes. The current literature on ‘soft' policy emphasizes the importance of tailoring behavior change campaigns to individual or geographic context. Yet, there is a lack of insight and appropriate tools to promote active mobility and overcome transport disadvantage from the local community perspective. The current study investigates the promotion of walking and cycling adoption using a series of focus groups with local residents in two geographic communities, namely Chicago's (1) Humboldt Park neighborhood and (2) suburb of Evanston. The research centers on analysis of the verbal transcripts. The approach combines traditional qualitative discourse analysis with quantitative text-mining tools, namely topic modeling and sentiment analysis. The aim of the analysis is to uncover the local mobility culture, embedded norms and values associated with acceptance of active travel modes in different communities. The analysis uncovers that underserved populations within diverse communities view active mobility simultaneously as a necessity and as a symbol of privilege that is sometimes at odds with the local culture. Thereby, this research expands on the walking and cycling literature by providing novel insights regarding the perceived benefits of, and barriers to, equitable promotion of these modes. The mixed methods approach to analyzing community member discourses is translated into policy findings that are either tailored to local context or broadly applicable to curbing automobile dominance. Overall, residents of both Humboldt Park and Evanston envision a society in which multimodalism replaces car-centrism, but differences in the local physical and social environments would and should influence the manner in which overarching policy objectives are met.},

We cover major historical milestones in the development of this specialism from the 1960s to today and discuss its relationship with the sociology of scientific knowledge, the library and information sciences, and science policy issues such as indicator development. The disciplinary organization of scientometrics is analyzed both conceptually and empirically. A state-of-the-art review of five major research threads is provided.},

abstract = {Evidence-based medicine has recently received a large amount of attention in medical research. To help clinical practices use evidence-based medicine, it should be easy to find the best current evidence that is relevant to the clinical question and has high methodological quality. However, searching for relevant articles and appraising their validity is demanding work for most clinicians. We hypothesize that, through an effective design that addresses the two major aspects - relevance and quality - together with a ranking algorithm, search engines can automatically retrieve articles that are relevant to clinical questions and are based on valid evidence. The contribution of this study has two parts. First, we approach this problem by combining methodologies. After designing a suitable document query-relevance score and methodological quality score, we combined them using various fusion methods. The result was a twofold increase in the mean average precision. Second, for correct evaluation, we built a test collection using a preexisting reliable database, the Cochrane Reviews, which allowed robust and comprehensive evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Systematic reviews are being increasingly used to inform all levels of healthcare, from bedside decisions to policy-making. Since they are designed to minimize bias and subjectivity, they are a preferred option to assess the comparative effectiveness and safety of healthcare interventions. However, producing systematic reviews and keeping them up-to-date is becoming increasingly onerous for three reasons. First, the body of biomedical literature is expanding exponentially with no indication of slowing down. Second, as systematic reviews gain wide acceptance, they are also being used to address more complex questions (e.g., evaluating the comparative effectiveness of many interventions together rather than focusing only on pairs of interventions). Third, the standards for performing systematic reviews have become substantially more rigorous over time. To address these challenges, we must carefully prioritize the questions that should be addressed by systematic reviews and optimize the processes of research synthesis. In addition to reducing the workload involved in planning and conducting systematic reviews, we also need to make efforts to increase the transparency, reliability and validity of the review process; these aims can be grouped under the umbrella of 'modernization' of the systematic review process. {\textcopyright} 2013 Future Medicine Ltd.},

abstract = {Keeping track of conceptual and methodological developments is a critical skill for research scientists, but this task is increasingly difficult due to the high rate of academic publication. As a crisis discipline, conservation science is particularly in need of tools that facilitate rapid yet insightful synthesis. We show how a common text-mining method (latent Dirichlet allocation, or topic modeling) and statistical tests familiar to ecologists (cluster analysis, regression, and network analysis) can be used to investigate trends and identify potential research gaps in the scientific literature. We tested these methods on the literature on ecological surrogates and indicators. Analysis of topic popularity within this corpus showed a strong emphasis on monitoring and management of fragmented ecosystems, while analysis of research gaps suggested a greater role for genetic surrogates and indicators. Our results show that automated text analysis methods need to be used with care, but can provide information that is complementary to that given by systematic reviews and meta-analyses, increasing scientists' capacity for research synthesis.

Moreover, we introduce a glyph-based representation for each speaker turn based on linguistic and statistical cues to abstract relevant text features. We present animated views for exploring the general behavior and interactions of speakers over time and interactive steady visualizations for the detailed analysis of a selection of speakers. Using a visual sedimentation metaphor we enable the analysts to track subtle changes in the flow of a conversation over time while keeping an overview of all past speaker turns.

We contribute to the understanding of public views on climate change and to knowledge needed by decision-makers by using a new approach to analyse answers to the open survey question ' what comes to mind when you hear the words ' climate change' ?'. We apply automated text analysis, specifically structural topic modelling, which induces distinct topics based on the relative frequencies of the words used in 2,115 responses. From these data, originating from the new, nationally representative Norwegian Citizen Panel, four distinct topics emerge: Weather/Ice, Future/Impact, Money/Consumption and Attribution. We find that Norwegians emphasize societal aspects of climate change more than do respondents in previous US and UK studies. Furthermore, variables that explain variation in closed questions, such as gender and education, yield different and surprising results when employed to explain variation in what respondents emphasize. Finally, the sharp distinction between scepticism and acceptance of conventional climate science, often seen in previous studies, blurs in many textual responses as scepticism frequently turns into ambivalence.},

abstract = {This extended editorial explores the growing range of stratagems devised by journal editors to boost their Journal Impact Factor (JIF) and the consequences for the credibility of this indicator as well as for the academic community more broadly. Over recent years, JIF has become the most prominent indicator of a journal's standing, bringing intense pressure on journal editors to do what they can to increase it. After explaining the curious way in which JIF is calculated and the technical limitations that beset it, we examine the approaches employed by journal editors to maximise it. Some approaches would seem completely acceptable, others (such as coercive citations and cross-citing journal cartels) are in clear breach of the conventions on academic behaviour, but a number fall somewhere in between. Over time, editors have devised ingenious ways of enhancing their JIF without apparently breaching any rules. In particular, the editorial describes the 'online queue' stratagem and asks whether this constitutes appropriate behaviour or not. The editorial draws three conclusions. First, in the light of ever more devious ruses of editors, the JIF indicator has now lost most of its credibility. Secondly, where the rules are unclear or absent, the only way of determining whether particular editorial behaviour is appropriate or not is to expose it to public scrutiny. Thirdly, editors who engage in dubious behaviour thereby risk forfeiting their authority to police misconduct among authors.},

@inproceedings{ISI:000337169400037,
abstract = {Among global issues of the twenty-first century are: population growth,
increase in energy demand, enrichment of atmospheric concentration of
greenhouse gases (GHGs) and the attendant climate change, increase in
food production needed to meet the demands of growing and increasingly
affluent population, and aggravated risks of soil and environmental
degradation. Thus, enhancing the magnitude and mean residence time (MRT)
of soil carbon (C) pool is integral to any strategy of addressing these
and other related global issues. The promise of soil C sequestration is
based on the magnitude of net biome productivity (NBP) of similar to 3
Pg C/year, and the hypothesis that some of the NBP can be retained in
the soil to offset emissions and also enhance the resilience of soil and
agroecosystems to climate change. Complementary to soil organic C (SOC)
is soil inorganic C (SIC) pool, together estimated at similar to 4,000
Pg to 3-m depth, and play a major role in the global C cycle (GCC). The
soil C sink capacity has been enhanced by depletion of the antecedent
SOC pool in degraded soils. Despite the large potential of 0.5-1 Mg
C/ha/year, there are numerous uncertainties: (1) increased emissions of
GHGs with increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 because of
accelerated decomposition and erosional processes, (2) change in the
rate of C uptake in soils of the tropics by climate change, (3) impact
of chemical weathering of silicate rocks in altering terrestrial sinks,
(4) unknown fate of C transported by erosional processes, (5) a possible
positive feedback from the melting of permafrost, (6) decrease in
capacity of terrestrial sinks because of soil degradation, and (7) the
effects of wild/managed fi res on soot, charcoal and NBP.
These uncertainties interact with mechanisms of SOC stabilization and
those which enhance its MRT. These mechanisms include: physical
protection through deep placement and formation of stable aggregates,
interaction between SOC and clay minerals, landscape position, and
humification leading to formation of recalcitrant fractions. There is a
vast potential of SOC sequestration through adoption of recommended
management practices on croplands (e.g., conservation agriculture, cover
cropping, integrated nutrient management) grazing lands (e.g.,
controlled grazing, better forage/tree species, soil and water
conservation), forestlands (e.g., afforestation, stand management,
species selection), wetland/peatland restoration, and reclamation of
degraded soils. Comparatively low rate of SIC sequestration as pedogenic
carbonates exist in vast arid and semi-arid lands, and in agroecosystems
irrigated with good quality water. However, there are also challenges of
credible measurements of small changes in soil C in a relatively large
pool, and of scaling up the data from profi le to watershed and regional
scale. There are numerous co-effects of soil C sequestration including
improvements in soil quality, increase in agronomic productivity,
enhancement of biodiversity, reduction in non-point source pollution
etc. Payments to land managers for ecosystem services and trading of C
credits may enhance adoption of recommended technologies especially by
resource-poor farmers, and small landholders in the tropics.
Researchable priorities include understanding of trends and variability
in principal determinants of SOC pools and its MRT, assessing the impact
of C-climate feed-backs and understanding coupled cycling of C with
other elements (N, P, S) and H2O. Soil C sequestration has a finite sink
capacity. However, it has numerous co-benefits (e.g., food security),
and is a cost-effective, win-win option, and a bridge to the future
until low-C or no-C fuel sources take effect.},

Method: The authors investigated the opinions of researchers with
experience of systematic reviews in the healthcare and social sciences
domains. They used semi-structured interviews to elicit their
experiences of systematic reviews and SR support tools.
Results: Study participants found broadly the same problems as software
engineering (SE) researchers with the SR process. They agreed with the

although there were some differences, the majority of the importance
assessments were very close.
Conclusions: In the context of SRs, the experiences of researchers in

abstract = {We revisit the problem of interval estimation of a binomial proportion. The erratic behavior of the coverage probability of the standard Wald confidence interval has previously been remarked on in the literature (Blyth and Still, Agresti and Coull, Santner and others). We begin by showing that the chaotic coverage properties of the Wald interval are far more persistent than is appreciated. Furthermore, common textbook prescriptions regarding its safety are misleading and defective in several respects and cannot be trusted. This leads us to consideration of alternative intervals. A number of natural alternatives are presented, each with its motivation and context. Each interval is examined for its coverage probability and its length. Basedon this analysis, we recommendthe Wilson interval or the equaltailed Jeffreys prior interval for small n and the interval suggested in Agresti and Coull for larger n. We also provide an additional frequentist justification for use of the Jeffreys interval},

abstract = {Bibliometric mapping of scientific articles based on keywords and technical terms in abstracts is now frequently used to chart scientific fields. In contrast, no significant mapping has been applied to the full texts of non-specialist documents. Editorials in Nature and Science are such non-specialist documents, reflecting the views of the two most read scientific journals on science, technology and policy issues. We use the VOSviewer mapping software to chart the topics of these editorials. A term map and a document map are constructed and clusters are distinguished in both of them. The validity of the document clustering is verified by a manual analysis of a sample of the editorials. This analysis confirms the homogeneity of the clusters obtained by mapping and augments the latter with further detail. As a result, the analysis provides reliable information on the distribution of the editorials over topics, and on differences between the journals. The most striking difference is that Nature devotes more attention to internal science policy issues and Science more to the political influence of scientists.

abstract = {Background: Systematic reviews address a specific clinical question by unbiasedly assessing and analyzing the pertinent literature. Citation screening is a time-consuming and critical step in systematic reviews. Typically, reviewers must evaluate thousands of citations to identify articles eligible for a given review. We explore the application of machine learning techniques to semi-automate citation screening, thereby reducing the reviewers' workload.Results: We present a novel online classification strategy for citation screening to automatically discriminate "relevant" from "irrelevant" citations. We use an ensemble of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) built over different feature-spaces (e.g., abstract and title text), and trained interactively by the reviewer(s).Semi-automating the citation screening process is difficult because any such strategy must identify all citations eligible for the systematic review. This requirement is made harder still due to class imbalance; there are far fewer "relevant" than "irrelevant" citations for any given systematic review. To address these challenges we employ a custom active-learning strategy developed specifically for imbalanced datasets. Further, we introduce a novel undersampling technique. We provide experimental results over three real-world systematic review datasets, and demonstrate that our algorithm is able to reduce the number of citations that must be screened manually by nearly half in two of these, and by around 40{\%} in the third, without excluding any of the citations eligible for the systematic review.Conclusions: We have developed a semi-automated citation screening algorithm for systematic reviews that has the potential to substantially reduce the number of citations reviewers have to manually screen, without compromising the quality and comprehensiveness of the review. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wallace et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Both carbon dioxide adsorption and desorption were investigated in the presence of air and water vapor. In a 24 h period, 2-3 g of carbon dioxide were adsorbed per 100 g of magnesium oxide. Desorption data shows that the carbon dioxide was largely physically adsorbed on the surface of the magnesium oxide and only a small fraction, if any, formed a carbonate. In view of this result, other high specific surface area sorbents may be more suitable for carbon dioxide collection from the atmosphere at room temperature. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

This is analysed in contrast to traditional problem-solving strategies, including core science, applied science, and professional consultancy. We use the two attributes of systems uncertainties and decision stakes to distinguish among these. Postnormal science is appropriate when either attribute is high; then the traditional methodologies are ineffective. In those circumstances, the quality assurance of scientific inputs to the policy process requires an 'extended peer community', consisting of all those with a stake in the dialogue on the issue. Post-normal science can provide a path to the democratization of science, and also a response to the current tendencies to post-modernity. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

abstract = {1. The exponential growth of scientific literature – which we call the ‘big literature' phenomenon – has created great challenges in literature comprehension and synthesis. The traditionalmanual literature synthesis processes are often unable to take advantage of big literature due to human limitations in time and cognition, creating the need for new literature synthesismethods to address this challenge. 2. In this paper, we discuss a highly useful literature synthesis approach, automated content analysis (ACA), which has not yet been widely adopted in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. ACA is a suite of machine learning tools for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of big literature commonly used in the social sciences andinmedical research. 3. Our goal is to introduce ecologists and evolutionary biologists toACAand illustrate its capacity to synthesize overwhelming volumes of literature. First,we provide a brief history of theACAmethod and summarize the fun- damental process of ACA. Next, we present two ACA studies to illustrate the utility and versatility of ACA in synthesizing ecological and evolutionary literature. Finally,we discuss how tomaximize the utility and contribu- tionsofACA,aswellaspotential research directions that may help to advance the use ofACAin future ecologi- cal and evolutionary research. 4. Unlikemanualmethods of literature synthesis, ACA is able to process high volumes of literature at substan- tially shorter time spans, while helping to mitigate human biases. The overall efficiency and versatility of this method allow for a broad range of applications for literature review and synthesis, including both exploratory reviews and systematic reviews aiming to addressmore targeted research questions. By allowing formore exten- sive and comprehensive reviews of big literature,ACAhas the potential to fill an important methodological gap and therefore contribute to the advancement of ecological and evolutionary research.},

Appraisals of deliberate, large-scale interventions in the earth's climate system, known collectively as ‘geoengineering', have largely taken the form of narrowly framed and exclusive expert analyses that prematurely ‘close down' upon particular proposals. Here, we present the findings from the first ‘upstream' appraisal of geoengineering to deliberately ‘open up' to a broader diversity of framings, knowledges and future pathways. We report on the citizen strand of an innovative analytic–deliberative participatory appraisal process called Deliberative Mapping. A select but diverse group of sociodemographically representative citizens from Norfolk (United Kingdom) were engaged in a deliberative multi-criteria appraisal of geoengineering proposals relative to other options for tackling climate change, in parallel to symmetrical appraisals by diverse experts and stakeholders. Despite seeking to map divergent perspectives, a remarkably consistent view of option performance emerged across both the citizens' and the specialists' deliberations, where geoengineering proposals were outperformed by mitigation alternatives.},

abstract = {Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) has great environmental implications due to its important role in ecosystem and global nitrogen cycle, as well as contribution to secondary particle formation. Here, we report long-term continuous measurements of NH3 at different locations (i.e. urban, industrial and rural) in Shanghai, China, which provide an unprecedented portrait of temporal and spatial characteristics of atmospheric NH3 in and around this megacity. In addition to point emission sources, air masses originated from or that have passed over ammonia rich areas, e.g. rural and industrial sites, increase the observed NH3 concentrations inside the urban area of Shanghai. Remarkable high-frequency NH3 variations were measured at the industrial site, indicating instantaneous nearby industrial emission peaks. Additionally, we observed strong positive exponential correlations between NH4(+)/(NH4(+)+NH3) and sulfate-nitrate-ammonium (SNA) aerosols, PM2.5 mass concentrations, implying a considerable contribution of gas-to-particle conversion of ammonia to SNA aerosol formation. Lower temperature and higher humidity conditions were found to favor the conversion of gaseous ammonia to particle ammonium, particularly in autumn. Although NH3 is currently not included in China's emission control policies of air pollution precursors, our results highlight the urgency and importance of monitoring gaseous ammonia and improving its emission inventory in and around Shanghai.},

Here we examine nearly 500 editorials published in these two journals between 1966 and 2016 that deal with climate change, thereby constructing a lens through which to view the changing engagement of science and scientists with the issue. A systematic longitudinal frame analysis reveals broad similarities between Nature and Science in the waxing and waning of editorializing attention given to the topic, but, although both journals have diversified how they frame the challenges of climate change, they have done so in different ways. We attribute these differences to three influences: the different political and epistemic cultures into which they publish; their different institutional histories; and their different editors and editorial authorship practices.},

Given budget and time constraints, limiting the recall of a search may undermine the quality of a review to such a degree that the validity of its findings is questionable. In this paper, we investigate a variable threshold approach to tackle the problem of a total recall task in medical reviews proposed by a Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) eHealth lab in 2017. Compared to the official results submitted to the CLEF eHealth task, our approach performed consistently better over all the range of thresholds considered achieving a recall greater than 0.95 with 25,000 documents less than the best performing systems.

They discuss some of the pitfalls of these types of analyses and summarize recent developments such as the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence. They suggest that evidence synthesis should become a regular companion to primary scientific research to maximize the effectiveness of scientific inquiry, but call for the rigorous application of stricter quality criteria for the publication of meta-analyses.},

abstract = {In the challenging context of intense negotiations and radical developments in the field of climate policy, informing stakeholders about opportunities and pathways and about scientific insights and warnings is important to help create positive dynamics. Policy makers need digestible information to design good policies, and understand their options and the possible impacts of these options. They need access to well-structured knowledge, as well as appropriate techniques to manage information and data. However, available information is often difficult to access, not in the right format and of limited use to stakeholders. The range of knowledge needs identified has to be effectively addressed by providing interested parties with suitable, to-the-point information, covering the identified gaps. This is the main aim of this article that proposes the design and development of a climate policy database, which contains all the resources that can cover the identified knowledge gaps. The resources are derived from a broad range of existing reports, research and climate policy decisions at different levels. The goal is to render climate policy associated stakeholders able to extract key policy conclusions. The added value of this database was verified by users and stakeholders that generally argued that the climate policy database facilitates solid understanding of climate policy implications and fosters collaborative knowledge exchange in the field.},

abstract = {W hat can quantitative linguistic analysis tell us about the operations and outlook of the international financial institutions? At first glance, the words most frequently used in the World Bank's Annual Reports give an impression of unbroken continuity. 1 Seven are near the top at any given time: three nouns—bank, loan/s, development—and four adjec-tives: fiscal, economic, financial, private. This septet is joined by a handful of other nouns: ibrd, countries, investment/s, interest, programme/s, project/s, assistance, and—though initially less frequent—lending, growth, cost, debt, trade, prices. There is also a second, more colourless set of adjectives—other, new, such, net, first, more, general—plus agricultural, partly replaced from the 1990s by rural. 2 The message is clear: the World Bank lends money for the purpose of stimulating development, notably in the rural South, and is therefore involved with loans, investments and debts. It works through programmes and projects, and considers trade a key resource for economic growth. Being concerned with devel-opment, the Bank deals with all sorts of economic, financial and fiscal matters, and is in touch with private business. All quite simple, and perfectly straightforward. And yet, behind this fa{\c{c}}ade of uniformity, a major metamorphosis has taken place. Here is how the Bank's Report described the world in 1958: The Congo's present transport system is geared mainly to the export trade, and is based on river navigation and on railroads which lead from river ports into regions producing minerals and agricultural commodities. Most of the roads radiate short distances from cities, providing farm-to-market 76 nlr 92 communications. In recent years road traffic has increased rapidly with the growth of the internal market and the improvement of farming methods. And here is the Report from half a century later, in 2008: Levelling the playing field on global issues Countries in the region are emerging as key players on issues of global concern, and the Bank's role has been to support their efforts by partnering through innovative platforms for an enlightened dialogue and action on the ground, as well as by supporting South–South cooperation. It's almost another language, in both semantics and grammar. The key discontinuity, as we shall see, falls mostly between the first three decades and the last two, the turn of the 1990s, when the style of the Reports becomes much more codified, self-referential and detached from every-day language. It is this Bankspeak that will be the protagonist of the pages that follow. i. semantic transformations},

abstract = {Dynamic topic models (DTMs) model the evolution of prevalent themes in literature, online media, and other forms of text over time. DTMs assume that word co-occurrence statistics change continuously and therefore impose continuous stochastic process priors on their model parameters. These dynamical priors make inference much harder than in regular topic models, and also limit scalability. In this paper, we present several new results around DTMs. First, we extend the class of tractable priors from Wiener processes to the generic class of Gaussian processes (GPs). This allows us to explore topics that develop smoothly over time, that have a long-term memory or are temporally concentrated (for event detection). Second, we show how to perform scalable approximate inference in these models based on ideas around stochastic variational inference and sparse Gaussian processes. This way we can train a rich family of DTMs to massive data. Our experiments on several large-scale datasets show that our generalized model allows us to find interesting patterns that were not accessible by previous approaches.},

abstract = {The challenge of meeting human development needs while protecting the earth's life support systems confronts scientists, technologists, policy makers, and communities from local to global levels. Many believe that science and technology (S{\&}T) must play a more central role in sustainable development, yet little systematic scholarship exists on how to create institutions that effectively harness S{\&}T for sustainability. This study suggests that efforts to mobilize S{\&}T for sustainability are more likely to be effective when they manage boundaries between knowledge and action in ways that simultaneously enhance the salience, credibility, and legitimacy of the information they produce. Effective systems apply a variety of institutional mechanisms that facilitate communication, translation and mediation across boundaries.},

abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has completed its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). Here, we explore the social scientific networks informingWorking Group III (WGIII) assessment of mitigation for the AR5. Identifying authors' institutional pathways, we highlight the persistence and extent of North–South inequalities in the authorship of the report, revealing the dominance of US and UK institutions as training sites for WGIII authors. Examining patterns of co-authorship between WGIII authors, we identify the unevenness in co-authoring relations, with a small number of authors co-writing regularly and indicative of an epistemic community's influence over the IPCC's definition of mitigation. These co-authoring networks follow regional patterns, with significant EU–BRICS collaboration and authors from the US relatively insular. From a disciplinary perspective, economists, engineers, physicists and natural scientists remain central to the process, with insignificant participation of scholars from the humanities. The shared training and career paths made apparent through our analysis suggest that the idea that broader geographic participation may lead to a wider range of viewpoints and cultural understandings of climate change mitigation may not be as sound as previously thought.},

Peak Energy Demand and Demand Side Response presents evidence on a set of Demand Side Response activities, ranging from price-based to incentive-based programmes and policies. Examples are drawn from different programmes for both residential and non-residential sectors of electricity demand, including Time of Use tariffs, Critical Peak Pricing Automated Demand Controllers and Ancillary Services. The book also looks at the actual energy saving impacts of smart meters, the activities which constitute peak demand and the potential opportunities associated with European smart grids and Capacity Markets. This is the first book presenting comprehensive analysis of the impacts, cost benefits and risks associated with Demand Side Response programmes and policies. It should be of interest to students, scholars and policy-makers in the areas of energy, environmental economics and applied economics.},

Climate change is an extremely complex issue that has exercised the minds of experts and policy makers with renewed urgency in recent years. It has prompted an explosion of writing in the media, on the internet and in the domain of popular science and literature, as well as a proliferation of new compounds around the word 'carbon' as a hub, such as 'carbon indulgence', a new compound that will be studied in this article. Through a linguistic analysis of lexical and discourse formations around such 'carbon compounds' we aim to contribute to a broader understanding of the meaning of climate change. Lexical carbon compounds are used here as indicators for observing how human symbolic cultures change and adapt in response to environmental threats and how symbolic innovation and transmission occurs. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The governance of knowledge is a crucial element of ecosystem-based management (EBM) and is deemed important for its effectiveness. In this paper we analyze from an empirical perspective how the governance of knowledge in different EBM practices is organized and with what consequences. Based upon four different case studies - all derived from the Wadden Sea - which resemble different contexts (in terms of available knowledge and level of conflict) we reconstruct four different ways of knowledge governance. These four approaches are labeled the database, the alignment, the assessment and the holistic approach. These approaches differ in how the interaction between knowledge production and decision-making is organized. They show different degrees of success, partly related to the extent to which they fit in the context in which they are applied. Understanding the differences in contexts in which knowledge for EBM has to be organized, can help decision-makers to apply the most suitable way of knowledge governance in their specific case. In cases of low conflict and high knowledge capacity a more static, one-directional way of knowledge governance can suffice, while in more complex contexts a holistic approach seems to be necessary.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The large and growing number of published studies, and their increasing rate of publication, makes the task of identifying relevant studies in an unbiased way for inclusion in systematic reviews both complex and time consuming. Text mining has been offered as a potential solution: through automating some of the screening process, reviewer time can be saved. The evidence base around the use of text mining for screening has not yet been pulled together systematically; this systematic review fills that research gap. Focusing mainly on non-technical issues, the review aims to increase awareness of the potential of these technologies and promote further collaborative research between the computer science and systematic review communities.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMETHODS: Five research questions led our review: what is the state of the evidence base; how has workload reduction been evaluated; what are the purposes of semi-automation and how effective are they; how have key contextual problems of applying text mining to the systematic review field been addressed; and what challenges to implementation have emerged? We answered these questions using standard systematic review methods: systematic and exhaustive searching, quality-assured data extraction and a narrative synthesis to synthesise findings.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nRESULTS: The evidence base is active and diverse; there is almost no replication between studies or collaboration between research teams and, whilst it is difficult to establish any overall conclusions about best approaches, it is clear that efficiencies and reductions in workload are potentially achievable. On the whole, most suggested that a saving in workload of between 30{\%} and 70{\%} might be possible, though sometimes the saving in workload is accompanied by the loss of 5{\%} of relevant studies (i.e. a 95{\%} recall).$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Using text mining to prioritise the order in which items are screened should be considered safe and ready for use in 'live' reviews. The use of text mining as a 'second screener' may also be used cautiously. The use of text mining to eliminate studies automatically should be considered promising, but not yet fully proven. In highly technical/clinical areas, it may be used with a high degree of confidence; but more developmental and evaluative work is needed in other disciplines.},

The focus was on whether conceptions of the transition to adulthood would be different among young-to-midlife adults compared to the younger age groups. In all age groups, individualistic criteria were the most likely to be considered important markers of the transition to adulthood, specifically accepting responsibility for one's actions, deciding on one's beliefs and values, establishing an equal relationship with parents, and becoming financially independent. However, young-to-midlife adults were less likely than adolescents to consider biological transitions to be important, and more likely than adolescents or emerging adults to view norm compliance (such as avoiding drunk driving) as a necessary part of the transition to adulthood. In all three groups, role transitions (e.g., marriage) ranked lowest in importance. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Yet, the design of classical survey experiments prevents them from identifying which components of a multidimensional treatment are influential. Here, we show how conjoint analysis, an experimental design yet to be widely applied in political science, enables researchers to estimate the causal effects of multiple treatment components and assess several causal hypotheses simultaneously. In conjoint analysis, respondents score a set of alternatives, where each has randomly varied attributes. Here, we undertake a formal identification analysis to integrate conjoint analysis with the potential outcomes framework for causal inference. We propose a new causal estimand and show that it can be nonparametrically identified and easily estimated from conjoint data using a fully randomized design. The analysis enables us to propose diagnostic checks for the identification assumptions. We then demonstrate the value of these techniques through empirical applications to voter decision making and attitudes toward immigrants.},

This review is concerned with the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): its origins and mandate; its disciplinary and geographical expertise; its governance and organizational learning; consensus and its representation of uncertainty; and its wider impact and influence on knowledge production, public discourse and policy development. The research that has been conducted on the IPCC as an institution has come mostly from science and technology studies scholars and a small number of critical social scientists. The IPCC's influence on the construction, mobilization and consumption of climate change knowledge is considerable. The review therefore ends by encouraging geographers of science to turn their research and scholarship to understanding the roles played by the IPCC, and equivalent institutional processes of climate change knowledge assessment, in the contemporary world.},

In this Perspective, we analyse how indigenous content is covered and framed in the Working Group II (WGII) portion of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). We find that although there is reference to indigenous content in WGII, which increased from the Fourth Assessment Report, the coverage is general in scope and limited in length, there is little critical engagement with indigenous knowledge systems, and the historical and contextual complexities of indigenous experiences are largely overlooked.

abstract = {The objective of technology-assisted review (" TAR ") is to find as much relevant information as possible with reason-able effort. Quality is a measure of the extent to which a TAR method achieves this objective, while reliability is a measure of how consistently it achieves an acceptable result. We are concerned with how to define, measure, and achieve high quality and high reliability in TAR. When quality is defined using the traditional goal-post method of specifying a minimum acceptable recall threshold, the quality and reli-ability of a TAR method are both, by definition, equal to the probability of achieving the threshold. Assuming this defini-tion of quality and reliability, we show how to augment any TAR method to achieve guaranteed reliability, for a quan-tifiable level of additional review effort. We demonstrate this result by augmenting the TAR method supplied as the baseline model implementation for the TREC 2015 Total Recall Track, measuring reliability and effort for 555 top-ics from eight test collections. While our empirical results corroborate our claim of guaranteed reliability, we observe that the augmentation strategy may entail disproportionate effort, especially when the number of relevant documents is low. To address this limitation, we propose stopping criteria for the model implementation that may be applied with no additional review effort, while achieving empirical reliability that compares favorably to the provably reliable method. We further argue that optimizing reliability according to the traditional goal-post method is inconsistent with certain subjective aspects of quality, and that optimizing a Taguchi quality loss function may be more apt.},

We compare heat, power, and CO2 balances of systems with alternative configurations of the CHP and CO2-capture systems. Because the captured CO2 comes from renewable biomass, the studied systems yield negative CO2 emissions. It is shown that pulp mills and integrated pulp and paper mills have the potential to become net exporters of biomass-based electricity while at the same time removing CO2 from the atmosphere on a net basis. The study shows that that the overall best CO2 abatement is achieved when CO2 capture is carried out within a biomass integrated gasifier with combined cycle where the syngas undergoes a CO-shift reaction. This configuration combines efficient energy conversion with a high CO2 capture efficiency. Furthermore, cost curves are constructed, which show how the cost of CO2 capture and storage in pulp and paper mills depends on system configuration and the CO2 transportation distance. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Learning meaningful topic models with massive document collections which contain millions of documents and billions of tokens is challenging because of two reasons: First, one needs to deal with a large number of topics (typically in the order of thousands). Second, one needs a scalable and efficient way of distributing the computation across multiple machines. In this paper we present a novel algorithm F+Nomad LDA which simultaneously tackles both these problems. In order to handle large number of topics we use an appropriately modified Fenwick tree. This data structure allows us to sample from a multinomial distribution over {\$}T{\$} items in {\$}O(\backslashlog T){\$} time. Moreover, when topic counts change the data structure can be updated in {\$}O(\backslashlog T){\$} time. In order to distribute the computation across multiple processor we present a novel asynchronous framework inspired by the Nomad algorithm of $\backslash$cite{\{}YunYuHsietal13{\}}. We show that F+Nomad LDA significantly outperform state-of-the-art on massive problems which involve millions of documents, billions of words, and thousands of topics.},

abstract = {Topic discovery has witnessed a significant growth as a field of data mining at large. In particular, time-evolving topic discovery, where the evolution of a topic is taken into account has been instrumental in understanding the historical context of an emerging topic in a dynamic corpus. Traditionally, time-evolving topic discovery has focused on this notion of time. However, especially in settings where content is contributed by a community or a crowd, an orthogonal notion of time is the one that pertains to the level of expertise of the content creator: the more experienced the creator, the more advanced the topic. In this paper, we propose a novel time-evolving topic discovery method which, in addition to the extracted topics, is able to identify the evolution of that topic over time, as well as the level of difficulty of that topic, as it is inferred by the level of expertise of its main contributors. Our method is based on a novel formulation of Constrained Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization, which adopts constraints well-motivated for, and, as we demonstrate, are essential for high-quality topic discovery. We qualitatively evaluate our approach using real data from the Physics and also Programming Stack Exchange forum, and we were able to identify topics of varying levels of difficulty which can be linked to external events, such as the announcement of gravitational waves by the LIGO lab in Physics forum. We provide a quantitative evaluation of our method by conducting a user study where experts were asked to judge the coherence and quality of the extracted topics. Finally, our proposed method has implications for automatic curriculum design using the extracted topics, where the notion of the level of difficulty is necessary for the proper modeling of prerequisites and advanced concepts.},

The study was conducted using data from the Scopus database over the time period of 2000-2010. We investigated the research landscape in Sustainable Development at country level and at institute level. Sustainable Development and its sub-areas are defined by keywords vetted by the domain experts, allowing publications to be identified independent of the journals and conferences in which they are published. The results indicate that institutes strong in Sustainable Development overall may not be strong in all sub-areas and that institutes not strong in Sustainable Development overall may have significant niche strengths in a given sub-area. It is also noted that China appears strong in terms of publication output in Sustainable Development and its sub-areas but it does not appear strong in terms of citation counts. The information produced in this study can be useful for government research agencies in terms of understanding how to more effectively knit together the various niche strengths in the country; and for the institutes to find strategic partners that can coordinate in niche areas of Sustainable Development and complement their strengths. In order to conduct bibliometric analysis in an interdisciplinary research area, the keyword collection approach appears to be very useful. This approach is flexible and can be used to conduct such analysis for interdisciplinary research fields.},

Though this is widely accepted, there has been less emphasis on the problem of trade-offs between these attributes, and how the trade-offs manifest themselves in practice. Based on empirical material on biodiversity-related science–policy interfaces, we identify four major potential trade-offs: first, personal time trade-off: interfacing versus doing other activities; secondly, a clarity–complexity trade-off: simple messages versus communicating uncertainty; thirdly, a speed–quality trade-off: timely outputs versus in-depth quality assessment; and finally, push–pull trade-off: supply-driven versus demand-driven research. Trade-offs are dynamic, vary through policy cycles, and evolve with changing contexts or internal dynamics between actors at the science–policy interface. We outline ways of easing the tensions inherent in trade-offs, but stress that appropriate solutions must be determined on a case-by-case basis.},

We examine how and why elements of organizational design, objectives, and the evolving political landscape have interacted and changed, with a view of informing the design and conduct of future processes. We find that the historical genesis of GEAs is closely connected to the emergence of environmental multilateralism. However, the prevailing conditions and assumptions which originally gave rise to the GEA concept have changed significantly over time, giving rise to an increasing demand for a focus on response options and policies. We also find that the epistemic and process complexity of GEAs has increased substantially, without a corresponding expansion in the magnitude and composition of GEA management teams. We suggest that developing analytical capacities for policy assessment as well as ensuring sufficient resources and tools to manage increasingly complex GEAs is essential to ensure their future relevance and success.

abstract = {One way to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere for the mitigation
of climate change is to capture the CO2 and inject it into geological
formations. The most important public concern about carbon capture and
storage (CCS) is whether stored CO2 will leak into groundwater sources
and finally into the atmosphere. To prevent the leakage, the possible
leakage paths and the mechanisms triggering the paths must be examined
and identified. It is known that the leakage paths can be due to CO2 -
rock interaction and CO2 - well interaction.
The objective of this research is to identify the geochemical reactions
of the dissolved CO2 in the synthetic formation water with the rock
minerals of the Sayindere cap rock by laboratory experiments. It is also
aimed to model and simulate the experiments using ToughReact software.
Sayindere formation is a regionally extensive cap rock for many oil
fields in southeastern Turkey.
The mineralogical investigation and fluid chemistry analysis of the
experiments show that calcite was dissolved from the cap rock core as a
result of CO2- water- rock interaction.
Using the reactive transport code TOUGHREACT, the modeling of the
dynamic experiment is performed. Calcite, the main primary mineral in
the Sayindere is dissolved first and then re-precipitated during the
simulation process. The decreases of 0.01 {\%} in the porosity and 0.03{\%}
in permeability of the packed core of the Sayindere cap rock are
observed in the simulation. The simulation was continued for 25 years
without CO2 injection. However, the results of this simulation show that
the porosity and permeability are increased by 0.001 {\%} and 0.004 {\%},
respectively due to the CO2-water-rock mineral interaction. This shows
that the Sayindere cap rock integrity must be monitored in the field if
application is planned. 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {—Much research has been devoted to topic detection from text, but one major challenge has not been addressed: revealing the rich relationships that exist among the detected topics. Finding such relationships is important since many applications are interested in how topics come into being, how they develop, grow, disintegrate, and finally disappear. In this paper, we present a novel method that reveal the inter-connections among topics discovered from the text data. Specifically, our method focuses on how one topic splits into multiple topics, and how multiple topics merge into one topic. We adopt the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) model, and propose an incremental Gibbs sampling algorithm to incrementally derive and refine the labels of clusters. We then characterize the splitting and merging patterns among clusters based on how labels change. We propose a global analysis process that focuses on cluster splitting and merging, and a finer-granularity analysis process that helps users to better understand the content of the clusters and the evolution patterns. We also develop a visualization to present the results.},

abstract = {Recent Global Burden of Disease (GBD) assessments estimated that outdoor fine-particulate matter (PM2.5) is a causal factor in over 5{\%} of global premature deaths. PM2.5 is produced by a variety of direct and indirect, natural and anthropogenic processes that complicate PM2.5 management. This study develops a proof-of-concept method to quantify the effects on global premature mortality of changes to PM2.5 precursor emissions. Using the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, we calculated sensitivities of global PM2.5-related premature mortality to emissions of precursor gases (SO2, NOx, NH3) and carbonaceous aerosols. We used a satellite-derived ground-level PM2.5 data set at approximately 10 x 10 km(2) resolution to better align the exposure with population density. We used exposure-response functions from the GBD project to relate mortality to exposure in the adjoint calculation. The response of global mortality to changes in local anthropogenic emissions varied spatially by several orders of magnitude. The largest reductions in mortality for a 1 kg km(-2) yr(-1) decrease in emissions were for ammonia and carbonaceous aerosols in Eastern Europe. The greatest reductions in mortality for a 10{\%} decrease in emissions were found for secondary inorganic sources in East Asia. In general, a 10{\%} decrease in SO2 emissions was the most effective source to control, but regional exceptions were found.},

abstract = {Most domestic energy use, most of the time, is invisible to the user. Most people have only a vague idea of how much energy they are using for different purposes and what sort of difference they could make by changing day-to-day behaviour or investing in efficiency measures. Hence the importance of feedback in making energy more visible and more amenable to understanding and control. This review considers what is known about the effectiveness of feedback to householders. The focus is on how people change their behaviour, not on the detail of the technology used. There is considerable variety in the feedback literature, but common themes emerge. The first studies, in the 1970s, established that feedback (mostly via display monitors) has measurable effects and was worth pursuing, on its own or in combination with other processes. Feedback came to be seen in terms of a learning tool, allowing energy users to teach themselves through experimentation. Overall, the literature demonstrates that clear feedback is a necessary element in learning how to control fuel use more effectively over a long period of time and that instantaneous direct feedback in combination with frequent, accurate billing (a form of indirect feedback) is needed as a basis for sustained demand reduction. Thus feedback is useful on its own, as a self- teaching tool. It is also clear that it improves the effectiveness of other information and advice in achieving better understanding and control of energy use.},

abstract = {Canada, Mexico and the United States formed the North American Carbon Atlas Partnership (NACAP) in December 2008 to collaborate in the development of a North American Carbon Storage Atlas (NACSA). This partnership was formally announced by the Presidents of the United States and Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada at their meeting in Guadalajara, Mexico, in August 2009. The NACAP effort identified and quantified large stationary sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, identified and screened sedimentary basins suitable for CO2 storage, and estimated the CO2 storage resources of the three most common types of geological media-oil and gas reservoirs, unmineable coal and deep saline formations-in those basins using publicly available geological data. To develop the atlas NACAP had to harmonize storage resource estimation methodologies, define a common scale and resolution, and develop procedures for the treatment of shared sedimentary basins across national borders. Although North America is a large emitter of CO2, the results of the assessments by the three countries demonstrate that potential CO2 storage resources in North America are hundreds, if not thousands, of times greater than current CO2 emissions. Certainly, practical considerations will reduce these estimates. The maps of the large stationary CO2 sources and of the CO2 storage resources show that the sources and storage resources frequently either overlay each other or are within manageable distances of each other, making carbon capture and storage an attractive option to reduce CO2 emissions.},

abstract = {In recent years, the full text of papers are increasingly available electronically which opens up the possibility of quantitatively investigating citation contexts in more detail. In this study, we introduce a new form of citation analysis, which we call citation concept analysis (CCA). CCA is intended to reveal the cognitive impact certain concepts -- published in a document -- have on the citing authors. It counts the number of times the concepts are mentioned (cited) in the citation context of citing publications. We demonstrate the method using three classical examples: (1) The structure of scientific revolutions by Thomas S. Kuhn, (2) The logic of scientific discovery - Logik der Forschung: Zur Erkenntnistheorie der modernen Naturwissenschaft in German -, and (3) Conjectures and refutations: the growth of scientific knowledge by Karl R. Popper. It is not surprising -- as our results show -- that Kuhn's "paradigm" concept has had a significant impact. What is surprising is that it has had such a disproportionately larger impact than Kuhn's other concepts, e.g., "scientific revolution". The paradigm concept accounts for over 80{\%} of the concept-related citations to Kuhn's work, and its impact is resilient across all disciplines and over time. With respect to Popper, "falsification" is the most used concept derived from his books. Falsification, after all, is the cornerstone of Popper's critical rationalism.},

abstract = {For more than a decade, the target of keeping global warming below 2 °C has been a key focus of the international climate debate. In response, the scientific community has published a number of scenario studies that estimate the costs of achieving such a target. Producing these estimates remains a challenge, particularly because of relatively well known, but poorly quantified, uncertainties, and owing to limited integration of scientific knowledge across disciplines. The integrated assessment community, on the one hand, has extensively assessed the influence of technological and socio-economic uncertainties on low-carbon scenarios and associated costs. The climate modelling community, on the other hand, has spent years improving its understanding of the geophysical response of the Earth system to emissions of greenhouse gases. This geophysical response remains a key uncertainty in the cost of mitigation scenarios but has been integrated with assessments of other uncertainties in only a rudimentary manner, that is, for equilibrium conditions. Here we bridge this gap between the two research communities by generating distributions of the costs associated with limiting transient global temperature increase to below specific values, taking into account uncertainties in four factors: geophysical, technological, social and political. We find that political choices that delay mitigation have the largest effect on the cost-risk distribution, followed by geophysical uncertainties, social factors influencing future energy demand and, lastly, technological uncertainties surrounding the availability of greenhouse gas mitigation options. Our information on temperature risk and mitigation costs provides crucial information for policy-making, because it clarifies the relative importance of mitigation costs, energy demand and the timing of global action in reducing the risk of exceeding a global temperature increase of 2 °C, or other limits such as 3 °C or 1.5 °C, across a wide range of scenarios.},

Energy services are largely ignorant of the particular resource that supplies them; however, often the infrastructures, technologies, and fuels along the delivery chain are highly dependent on a particular type of resource. The availability and costs of bringing energy resources to the market place are key determinants to affordable and accessible energy services. Energy resources pose no inherent limitation to meeting the rapidly growing global energy demand as long as adequate upstream investment is forthcoming – for exhaustible resources in exploration, production technology, and capacity (mining and field development) and, by analogy, for renewables in conversion technologies.},

Although crucial, the process used to select primary studies can be arduous, time consuming, and must often be conducted manually. Objective: We propose a novel approach, known as 'Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM, to support the primary study selection activity using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. Method: We conducted a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach. To enable the comparison, we also developed a VTM tool that implemented our approach. We hypothesized that students using SLR-VTM would present improved selection performance and effectiveness. Results: Our results show that incorporating VTM in the SLR study selection activity reduced the time spent in this activity and also increased the number of studies correctly included. Conclusions: Our pilot case study presents promising results suggesting that the use of VTM may indeed be beneficial during the study selection activity when performing an SLR.},

We design the algorithm for rank-2 NMF by exploiting the fact that an exhaustive search for the optimal active set can be performed extremely fast when solving these NNLS problems. In addition, we design a mea-sure on the results of rank-2 NMF for determining which leaf node should be further split. On a number of text data sets, our proposed method produces high-quality tree structures in significantly less time compared to other methods such as hierarchical K-means, standard NMF, and latent Dirichlet allocation.},

abstract = {Approximately 50{\%} of the photosynthesis on Earth each year occurs in
aquatic environments. Therefore, aquatic carbon fixation is particularly
relevant in the regulation of the global climate. However, previous work
concentrated mainly on the role of ocean aquatic photosynthesis in the
uptake of CO2 and/or HCO3-. Here, it is shown that the role of
terrestrial aquatic photosynthesis in the CO2 uptake, which utilizes
dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) by rock weathering to form the
autochthonous organic carbon, and thus decreases the CO2 release to
atmosphere from terrestrial aquatic systems, should not be neglected in
global budgeting in the carbon cycle. The magnitude of this carbon sink
may account for a few hundred million tons of carbon per year, and might
increase with the rise in DIC caused by global warming and anthropogenic
activities. The finding that terrestrial aquatic photosynthesis results
in the storage of significant amounts of DIC (CO2) has broad
implications. It indicates that the rock weathering-related carbon sink
is largely underestimated if only the DIC concentrations at river mouths
are considered, and transformation of DIC to autochthonous TOC is
neglected. It also indicates that the atmospheric CO2 sink due to
carbonate weathering might be significant in also controlling long-term
climate changes, due to the substantial production and burial of
autochthonous organic carbon. This challenges the traditional point of
view that only the chemical weathering of Ca-silicate rocks might
potentially control long-term climate change. (C) 2013 The Authors.

The problem is essentially related to almost all scientific disciplines and thus has attracted attention of scholars from different backgrounds. Progress on SOS will lead to better solutions for many challenging issues, ranging from the selection of candidate faculty members by a university to the development of research fields to which a country should give priority. While different measurements have been designed to evaluate the scientific impact of scholars, journals and academic institutions, the multiplex structure, dynamics and evolution mechanisms of the whole system have been much less studied until recently. In this article, we review the recent advances in SOS, aiming to cover the topics from empirical study, network analysis, mechanistic models, ranking, prediction, and many important related issues. The results summarized in this review significantly deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and statistical rules governing the science system. Finally, we review the forefront of SOS research and point out the specific difficulties as they arise from different contexts, so as to stimulate further efforts in this emerging interdisciplinary field.},

abstract = {In order to have an insight into the reaction between acid rain and
carbonate rock surface, and figure out the CO2 carbonate source amount
from the acid rain chemical weathering process of the carbonate rocks,
two typical carbonate rock areas Guilin (represents limestone area) and
Liuzhou (represents dolomite area) were chosen as the study areasin
Guangxi. According to the dissolution ratecalculated by the limestone
test piece and GIS analysis, the CO2 source produced by the acid rain
was 41.066x10(8)g/a, in which Guilin was 33.349x10(8)g/a and Liuzhou was
7.717x10(8)g/a. The carbon sources of unit area in Guilin and in Liuzhou
were66.967x10(5)g/a.km(2) and 42.777x105g/a.km(2) respectively. Although
the carbon sources were still less than their carbon sinks in Guilin and
Liuzhou which were 273.891 x10(5)g/a.km(2) and 43.660x 10(5)g/a-km(2)
respectively, they should not be neglected. There were two reasons that
the degassing rate of carbon source in Guilin was slower than that in
Liuzhou. One was the representative area of carbonate rock in Guilin
were 2.77 times of that in Liuzhou, the other one was that the total
intensity of acid rain of Guilin was lower than Liuzhou, so that the
dissolution rate of the carbonate rocks was lower in Guilin.
The chemical weathering of carbonate rock plays an important role
inmaterial circulation on earthsurfaceand climatic evolution. Many
scholars have been paid height attention on the global and regional rock
weathering and its weathering rate({\{}[{\}}1,2]). Because of the
karstification is having directlyeffect on atmospheric CO2
deposition(carbon sink), the contribution of carbonate rock weathering
to the atomspheric CO2 sink {\{}[{\}}(3-7)] and forming carbon stability is
the current hotspot({\{}[{\}}8]). But due to the effects of acid rain and the
vulnerability of ecosystem in karst area, acid rain has a certain
effecton the carbonate rock distributed areas, primarily presented the
difference that based on super acidcarbonate rock weathering and based
on carbonate weathering. Acid weathering of carbonate rock releases
metal ions, HCO3- and SO42- to the ocean, and because ofSO(4)(2-) has a
longer lag time than HCO(3)(-)and precipitation, thus there was net
release of greenhouse gases CO(2)to the atmosphere({\{}[{\}}9]); But this
process is not being considered in theglobal CO(2)cycle models at
present({\{}[{\}}10]); The surface of carbonate rocks are erosion by acid rain
(the main components is H2SO4) and CO2 is released, and then become the
source of atmospheric CO2. Therefore the studies on carbon sourcerelease
amount caused by acid rain have important scientific significance in
super acid weathering of carbonate rocks.},

abstract = {Assessment of the global burden of disease is based on epidemiological cohort studies that connect premature mortality to a wide range of causes, including the long-term health impacts of ozone and fine particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5). It has proved difficult to quantify premature mortality related to air pollution, notably in regions where air quality is not monitored, and also because the toxicity of particles from various sources may vary. Here we use a global atmospheric chemistry model to investigate the link between premature mortality and seven emission source categories in urban and rural environments. In accord with the global burden of disease for 2010 (ref. 5), we calculate that outdoor air pollution, mostly by PM2.5, leads to 3.3 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.61-4.81) million premature deaths per year worldwide, predominantly in Asia. We primarily assume that all particles are equally toxic, but also include a sensitivity study that accounts for differential toxicity. We find that emissions from residential energy use such as heating and cooking, prevalent in India and China, have the largest impact on premature mortality globally, being even more dominant if carbonaceous particles are assumed to be most toxic. Whereas in much of the USA and in a few other countries emissions from traffic and power generation are important, in eastern USA, Europe, Russia and East Asia agricultural emissions make the largest relative contribution to PM2.5, with the estimate of overall health impact depending on assumptions regarding particle toxicity. Model projections based on a business-as-usual emission scenario indicate that the contribution of outdoor air pollution to premature mortality could double by 2050.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates a large-scale pilot program run by a company called OPOWER, previ- ously known as Positive Energy, to mail home energy use reports to residential utility consumers. The reports include energy conservation information as well as social comparisons between a household's energy use and that of its neighbors. Using data from a randomized natural {\ldots}eld ex- periment at 80,000 treatment and control households in Minnesota, I estimate that the monthly program reduces energy consumption by 1.9 to 2.0 percent relative to baseline. In a treatment arm receiving reports each quarter, the e¤ects decay over the months between letters and in- crease again upon receipt of the next letter. I provide evidence to suggest that at least some of this e¤ect is because consumers'attention is malleable and non-durable. I show that “pro{\ldots}ling,” or using a statistical decision rule to target the program at households whose observable charac- teristics predict larger treatment e¤ects, could substantially improve cost e¤ectiveness in future programs. The results provide additional evidence that non-price “nudges”can substantially a¤ect consumer behavior.},

abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a fixed-length feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, "powerful," "strong" and "Paris" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperform bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.},
